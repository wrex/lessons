This is the fifth and final lesson on learning the notes of the fretboard::

1. [Just 12 notes. (Background material)]({{< ref "/page/1-just-12-notes.md" >}})
2. [Open and E strings]({{< ref "/page/2-open-and-e.md" >}})
3. [Fret 5 and String 5]({{< ref "/page/3-fret5-string5.md" >}})
4. [Octave Shapes]({{< ref "/page/4-octave-shapes.md" >}})
5. Whole Fretboard (this page)

This diagram of all the natural notes should look considerably less intimidating now:

</div>

We've already drilled extensively on the outside E strings and the A strings, but we still need to learn the remaining notes on the D, G, and B strings.

Following our philosophy of always doing the hardest thing first, let's first focus on the B string. We can get to the D and G strings using octave shapes from the outside strings, but it would take two steps to get to notes on the B string with octave shapes. The D and G strings can be reached with octave shapes from above or below in one step, but the B string requires two, so let's tackle it directly.

Exactly as we did with string 5, we first perform a set of focused exercises just on just the 2nd string:

<p></p>
{{% details "Exercise 16: B string focused drills" %}}
<div class="bg-info">
  <p>Start with the notes that are only one degree away from notes we already <strong>KNOW</strong>. Since we already know B and E, those notes are C, D, F and A.</p>

  <p>Practice finding these notes in order: C, then D, then F, then A. C is on the first fret, just one higher than the open B you alreadky <strong>KNOW</strong>. D is a whole step below the E on the fifth fret, etc. Repeat slowly until you're confident you know them in order: C D F A, C D F A, etc.</p>

  <p>Now go backward, AFDC.</p>

  <p>We should now be pretty close to <strong>KNOWING</strong> six of the seven notes on this string. All that is missing is G.
  </p>

  <p>Again, G is one of the "hard" notes that needs two step navigation to find, so dive in and try to learn that G even better than every other note on the string.</p>

  <p>Play the G after you find it. See where it sits. Visualize the note name "G" hovering over the fretboard at that location, and, as always, say the note name as you play it. Spend extra effort on this note until you know it in your sleep.</p>

  <p>Next we work through our familiar drills:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Work through the mostly-fourths sequence. Find, play, and say each note in as many places as you can reach on string 2.</p></li>
      <li> <p>Work through the notes in all the triads, finding each note in as many locations on string 2 as you can.</p> </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

You should now be pretty comfortable finding any notes on the outermost string pairs as well as the open notes and notes at the fifth and twelfth frets. In theory, you should **KNOW** all of these notes:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/outer-strings.png" title="The outermost string pairs" >}}
</div>

If you're like most people, though, even with all the drilling we've done so far, it still takes a bit of effort to find all of the notes in the diagram above. One way to make this easier is to first focus on just a few "landmarks" (pilotage) on each string.

We've not yet spent any focused time on the innermost strings, the D and G strings, but we already know a couple notes on them (open strings and fifth fret). Let's add just one more landmark to each of those strings.

Unlike the B string, *all* of the notes on the D and G strings can be reached in one step with octave shapes (that's why we focused on the B string first). Try to figure out which note on the D and G strings is more than one scale degree away from the three locations we already know (open, 5th fret, 12th fret). We want to turn *those* into landmarks as quickly as possible, before the last few remaining notes. (If you haven't figured it out already, those notes are B on the D string, and E on the G string.)

Remember, we have two ways to navigate from landmarks to other notes: moving up or down a few frets along the same string from notes we already **KNOW**, and using octave shapes from **KNOWN** notes on different strings. It's incredibly helpful to have at least three **KNOWN** notes fairly spread out on each string as quickly as possible. They make it easy to find the intervening notes without resorting to octave shapes.

Here's a diagram of what I consider the most critical "landmark" notes: open string, fifth fret, 12th fret, and "two-step" notes. If you really and truly **KNOW** these eighteen notes (three per string) you will never be more than one scale step away from finding any note on any string:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/landmark-notes.png" title="The most critical landmark notes" >}}
</div>

These are by far the most critical landmarks. Spend a lot of time with the next drill. Repeat the drill for several days (or weeks) until its automatic. Really hammer these notes home.

The sooner you really and truly **KNOW** these eighteen notes (the sooner you can pilot to these landmarks effortlessly) the sooner you'll be able to find *any* note on the fretboard. Navigating via dead reckoning in just one scale step up or down from a known landmark can be pretty quick and easy. If you **KNOW** these landmark notes, that's the hardest you'll ever have to work to find a note.

<div class="bg-info">
  <p>
    Work your way across the open strings, low to high, naming them as you go: E A D G B E.
  </p>

  <p>Next work down the notes on the fifth fret: A E C G D A.</p>

  <p>Now up across the "two-step" notes: C F B E G C. Name them as you play them, of course.</p>

  <p>Lastly, work down the notes at the 12th fret: E B G D A E.</p>

  <p>Now reverse the direction: up the 12th fret, down the two-step notes, up the 5th fret, and down the open strings.</p>

  <p>Next, play and name the landmark notes on each string, working low string to high: EACE ADFA DGBD GCEG BEGB EACE.</p>

  <p>Reverse that, too: high note to low note, high string to low. ECAE BGEB GECG DBGD AFDA ECAE.</p>

  <p>Finally, test yourself by randomly playing any of these notes and verifying you can name it instantly and effortlessly.</p>

We can now find any note by pilotage (just going to a landmark directly) or, worst case, moving up or down one or two frets from another note we already **KNOW**. Octave shapes provide another tool to verify or assist.

One more thing that can help, is to think of the semitone separated notes (B/C, and E/F) as almost one location. If you're playing a B, it takes almost zero mental effort to find the C (and vice versa). Same for E and F.

I recommend you continue to focus on the landmark notes above, but look at how much more of the fretboard we cover just by adding these adjacent notes:

<div class="text-center">

</div>

You get all the notes in grey almost for free!

### Whole fretboard drills

Be **sure** you truly **KNOW** all the landmark notes above before attempting any of the following drills, but the remainder of this page contains a number of exercises you should add to your daily practice schedule. You never completely get off of the treadmill, but you should definitely plan to be repeating these exercises for several months at least.

You can quit practicing these exercises when you "**KNOW** the fretboard" as well and completely as you know the colors and of flavors of various fruits, as well as you know your family's faces, and as well as the denominations of the coins in your pocket.

Congratulations! If you've made it this far and through all of these drills, you can be confident that you've truly learned the fretboard.
