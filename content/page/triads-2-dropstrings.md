This is part 2 of a 2-part series on triads:

1. [Triad Introduction]({{< ref "/page/1-triads.md" >}})
2. Triads on other strings (this page)

Triads exist on more than just the top three strings, of course. The shapes change slightly on each different course of three strings because of the way the guitar is tuned.

The best way to learn these additional shapes is using what Josh at [Fretboard Anatomy](https://fretboard-anatomy.com) calls "Octave Drop Chord Building." Basically, we use [familiar octave shapes]({{< ref "/page/4-octave-shapes.md" >}}) to drop the highest pitched note in a triad shape we already know one octave (and three strings) lower.

Starting with the root inversion C Major triad we already know:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/c-major-GBE-root.png" title="C Major triad, root inversion" width="33%" >}}
</div>

We drop the G on the highest string one octave and play it on the D string like this:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/c-major-DGB-2nd.png" title="C Major triad, 2nd inversion" width="33%" >}}
</div>

Since the fifth is now in the base, this is a 2nd inversion. You may recognize the shape from an open A chord (with that shape three frets lower down the neck).

We use the same process to move to the A, D, and G strings:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/c-major-ADG-1st.png" title="C Major triad, 1st inversion" width="33%" >}}
</div>

Then we find the root inversion in the same way on the low-E, A, and D strings:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/c-major-EAD-root.png" title="C Major triad, root inversion" width="33%" >}}
</div>

Note that we have a root inversion on both the lowest set of three strings and the highest set of three strings.

<div class="bg-info">
  <p>
    Work through the circle of fourths, finding all major chords on all sets of 3 adjacent strings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Start with B Major in root position on the the G/B/E strings. Then drop an octave onto D/G/B, then A/D/G, then E/A/D.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next proceed through E Major, A Major, D Major, ..., all the way through G&flat; Major.
  </p>
  <p>
    Play each triad as a chord (all voices sounding simultaneously) and as an arpeggio (one note sounded after another, lowest pitch to highest).
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, repeat the exercise, but this time start from the lowest course of three strings to the highest. Root position triad on E/A/D, then 1st inversion on A/D/G, then 2nd inversion on D/G/B, and finally, root inversion on G/B/E.

We want to train ourselves to visualize all four of these triad shapes (on each adjacent set of three strings) as a single entity. They are four different triad shapes, but we want to visualize how they all connect.

One way to accomplish this is by playing a six string arpeggio that connects all four shapes:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/cmaj-1-6strings.png" title="C Major Arpeggio 1">}}
</div>

The arpeggio [sounds like this](/audio/cmaj-1-6strings.mp3).

<br/>
{{% details "Exercise 4: 6-string arpeggio 1" %}}
<div class="bg-info">
  <p>
    Play arpeggio 1 above several times, with a metronome, until you are 100% confident in the shapes. Repeat for other chords as required (ideally working through the entire circle of fourths).
