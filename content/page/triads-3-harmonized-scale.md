This is part 3 of a multipart series on triads:

1. [Triad introduction and triads on G/B/E]({{< ref "/page/1-triads.md" >}})
2. [Major triads on other strings using octave drops]({{< ref "/page/triads-2-dropstrings.md" >}})
3. Harmonizing scales with triads (this page)

You now know all the close-voiced major and minor triad shapes on every string set, and all the major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads on the 1st string set (G/B/E strings).

Before moving onto the next session of practicing (and *applying*) triads across all the string sets, let's spend some time harmonizing the major and minor scales on just the first string set.

As we discussed in [just twelve notes]({{< ref "/page/1-just-12-notes.md" >}}), the major scale (AKA Ionian Mode) comprises just the seven natural notes C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.

We can create a triad for each of these notes by "stacking thirds" (playing every other note in the scale). We create a C triad from the notes C, E, and G (skipping over D and F). The next triad starts on D, and takes the notes D, F, and A, forming D minor triad. The process repeats for all seven notes in the scale.

Here's the table of these triads (chords) again:

| Chord name | Roman or "Nashville" notation | Notes
| --- | --- | ---
| C | I | C E G
| Dm | ii | D F A
| Em | iii | E G B
| F | IV | F A C
| G | V | G B D
| Am | vi | A C E
| Bdim | vii° | B D F

Notice that the I, IV, and V chords are major, and the ii, iii, and vi chords are minor. The only oddball is the triad formed by starting on the seventh degree of the scale (B diminished).

To "harmonize" a scale just means to play each of these chords in order. The harmonized C Major scale is the chords C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am, Bdim played in order.

Here is one way to play the harmonized C Major scale on the top three strings:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/C-harmonized-GBE.png" title="Harmonizing C Major" >}}
</div>

This diagram starts with the 2nd inversion C major triad (labeled "1" in the diagram). Then comes a Dm triad in green, then Em (blue), F, G, Am, Bdim, and finally back to C.

There are, of course, two more ways to harmonize the scale on these strings. Simply start with one of the other inversions of the C Major triad.

Any or all of those chords can be used to play songs in the key of C Major.

### Harmonizing Melodies

You can harmonize melodies within a key using the harmonized triads. The song "Happy birthday to you" is usually played in the key of C. The first line of the melody is the notes C, C, D, C, F, E. You *could* harmonize this simply by playing the chords C, C, Dm, C, F, Em.

It might sound better, though, to keep the melody in the top "voice" and use different inversions of various chords within the key. Perhaps:

C (1st inversion with C on top)
C (1st inversion with C on top)
Dm (2nd inversion with D on top)
F (root inversion with C on top)
F (2nd inversion with F on top)
C (2nd inversion with E on top)

### Other keys

The key of G Major contains the notes G A B C D E F&sharp;. Only one note (F&sharp;) differs from C Major. The chords are as follows:

| Chord name | Roman or "Nashville" notation | Notes
| --- | --- | ---
| G | I | G B D
| Am | ii | A C E
| Bm | iii | B D F&sharp;
| C | IV | C E G
| D | V | D F&sharp; A
| Em | vi | E G B
| F&sharp;dim | vii°| F&sharp; A C

Even with only one note changed, the chords change significantly. The B chord is now Bm instead of Bdim. D is now major, not minor. And we play F&sharp;dim instead of F major!

**But**, notice that the I, IV, and V chords are still major. The ii, iii, and vi chord still minor, and the vii° chord is still diminished. This remains true for **any** major scale, no matter how many sharps and flats.

The key of G&flat; is the notes G&flat;, A&flat;, B&flat;, C&flat;, D&flat;, E, and F&flat;. (Yes, we call it "C&flat;" here even though it's really the same pitch and same note as plain old B).

The chords in G&flat; are G&flat;, A&flat; minor, B&flat; minor, C&flat;, D&flat;, Em, and F&flat;dim.

Now let's practice playing harmonized scales on the top three strings.

<div class="bg-info">
  <p>
    Let's start with the key of C. Play the 2nd inversion C Major triad on G/B/E. Then move the root note up two frets to D and form the corresponding triad (Dm). Move up two more frets and play Em. Then one fret to F, two to G, two to Am, two more to the B <em>diminished</em> shape, and finally back to the C Major triad at the 13th fret. Refer to the diagram above if necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's try a different inversion. Play the root inversion C Major triad with the C on the G string at the 5th fret. Move the C up two frets and play Dm. Then Em, F, G, Am, Bdim, and C.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whenever you move two far up the neck to play comfortably, shift the shape one octave (twelve frets) lower and continue from there.
  </p>
  <p>
    Repeat with the 1st inversion C Major triad at the 8th fret.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, pick another key and play that harmonized scale using all three inversions. You can just pick a key at random or proceed through the cycle of fourths/fifths.
