Chords are just multiple notes played simultaneously. Technically, you can have two-note chords (AKA [dyads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(music))) but most people consider three-note chords to be the simplest possible place to start making real chord harmonies.

Triads are formed by "stacking" intervals of a minor or major 3rd on top of each other. Since there are two internal intervals between three notes, and because each interval can be either major or minor, there are logically four types of triads (minor+minor, minor+major, major+minor, and major+major).

The simplest form of a triad has the "root" note as the lowest pitch, the "third" in the middle, and the "fifth" as the highest pitch. This is called the "root position" or "root inversion" of the triad.

The four types of triads, in order of importance, are called:

1. Major: root + M3 + p5 (a major 3rd between the first two notes, and a minor 3rd interval between the next two)

2. Minor: root + m3 + p5 (a minor 3rd between the first two notes, and a major 3rd between the next two)

3. Diminished: root + m3 + &flat;5 (two minor third intervals stacked on top of each other)

4. Augmented: root + M3 + &sharp;5 (two major third intervals stacked on top of each other)

The first two (major and minor triads) are by far the most common and useful for making music. You should definitely learn them first.

The C Major triad comprises the notes C, E, and G. It's a minor 3rd stacked on top of a Major 3rd. The M3 interval between C and E is what gives the chord its "happy" sound.

The C minor triad comprises the notes C, E&flat;, and G. This time the minor 3rd between the first two notes is what gives it the "sad" or "poignant" quality.

Here is how to play the C Major and C minor triads on the top three strings:

</div>

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/c-minor-GBE-root.png" title="C minor triad, root inversion" width="33%" >}}
</div>

The are other ways of playing the three notes that comprise a C Major besides the root inversion.

There are, of course, six permutations of the three notes in the C Major triad: CEG, EGC, GCE, CGE, ECG, and GEC. the first three are called "close voicings" because the notes are as close together as possible. The others are called "spread voicings" or "drop chord voicings" because one of the notes (voices) is moved to a different octave and is no longer as close as possible to the others.

ECG is a spread voicing, for example, because there is another G in between E and C that is skipped over (the G in the chord is in a higher octave than the E). On the fretboard, you can only play a spread voicing by skipping a string. Only close voicings are playable on three adjacent strings.

We will limit ourselves to close voicings for the remainder of this page.

The three close voicings for C Major are:

* CEG (root inversion)

* EGC (1st inverion)

* GCE (2nd inversion)

On the top three strings of the fretboard, they look like this:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/C-Major-Inversions.png" title="C Major triads, all close-voiced inversions on G/B/E" >}}
</div>

Notice that when moving up the neck to the next inversion, each "voice" in the triad (lowest, middle, or highest pitch) moves up to the next higher note. C (root) moves to E (M3), E moves to G (p5), and G moves to C (root). CEG &rarr; EGC. The same thing going from first to second inversion: EGC &rarr; GCE. And again when repeating the next higher root inversion (at frets 15-17 if you can reach): GCE &rarr; CEG.

<p>
  We are going to find and play all 12 Major triads on the top three strings, in every inversion, by moving through the cycle of fourths.
</p>
<p>
  First find and play the B Major root position triad at frets 4-6 on the top three strings. Then play the 1st inversion B Major at frets 7-8, then 2nd inversion at frets 11-12. Continue up the neck as high as you can reach comfortably, e.g. the root position triad at frets 16-18 if you can reach.
</p>
<p>
  Next find all the close-voiced E Major triads on the top three strings. Then all the A Major triads.
</p>
<p>
  Continue through the entire cycle of fourths: B E A D G C F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; D&flat; G&flat;, and then back to B where the cycle repeats.
</p>
<p>
  As you progress through the cycle of fourths, always start with the lowest triad you can find on the top three strings (the inversion closest to the nut). Try <em>not</em> to always start with the same inversion.
</p>
<p>
  Trying to find the lowest triad may seem difficult at first. Just remember the open strings are G, B, and E. Whatever note you're looking for is going to be within a few frets of one of those notes. Sometimes the inversion you first consider needs (imaginary) notes below the open strings. Since you can't play imaginary notes, visualize the next inversion higher than the one you imagined first, and play that.
</p>
<p>
  You'll likely find this exercise quite difficult at first. Don't even attempt it until you are extremely confident that you <a href="{{< ref "/page/1-just-12-notes.md" >}}"><strong>KNOW</strong> the notes on the fretboard.</a> It's sufficiently difficult that you'll probably want to avoid performing this exercise with a metronome for quite a while. Wait until you are quite confident you can find all the triads quickly before even attempting to use a metronome.
</p>
<p>
  You can be <em>very</em> confident that you know the top three strings of the fretboard well if you can perform this exercise with a metronome at any tempo (even whole notes at 40 BPM).

It's certainly worthwhile to also drill with diminished and augmented triads, but these are used so much less frequently that it's perfectly okay to only work on Major and minor triads for now.
