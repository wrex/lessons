This is part 1 of a multipart series on triads:

1. Triad Introduction (this page)
2. [Triads on other strings]({{< ref "/page/triads-2-dropstrings.md" >}})

Chords are just multiple notes played simultaneously. Technically, you can have two-note chords (AKA [dyads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(music))) but most people consider three-note chords (called "triads") to be the simplest possible place to start making real chord harmonies.

Triads are formed by "stacking" intervals of a minor or major 3rd on top of each other. Since there are two internal intervals between three notes, and because each interval can be either major or minor, there are logically four types of triads (minor+minor, minor+major, major+minor, and major+major).

The four types of triads, in order of importance, are called:

1. Major: root + M3 + p5 (a major 3rd between the first two notes, and a minor 3rd interval between the next two)

2. Minor: root + m3 + p5 (a minor 3rd between the first two notes, and a major 3rd between the next two)

3. Diminished: root + m3 + &flat;5 (two minor third intervals stacked on top of each other)

4. Augmented: root + M3 + &sharp;5 (two major third intervals stacked on top of each other)

The first two (major and minor triads) are by far the most common and useful for making music. You should definitely learn them first.

The C Major triad comprises the notes C, E, and G. It's a minor 3rd stacked on top of a Major 3rd. The M3 interval between C and E is what gives the chord its "happy" sound.

The C minor triad comprises the notes C, E&flat;, and G. This time the minor 3rd between the first two notes is what gives it the "sad" or "poignant" quality.

Here is how to play the C Major and C minor triads on the top three strings:

<div class="text-center">

</div>

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/c-minor-GBE-root.png" title="C minor triad, root inversion" width="33%" >}}
</div>

When the root note is the lowest pitch like this (ordered root, 3rd, 5th from lowest pitch to highest) we call the form of the triad the "root position" or "root inversion".

There are other ways of playing the three notes that comprise a C Major besides the root inversion.

There are, of course, six permutations of the three notes in the C Major triad: CEG, EGC, GCE, CGE, ECG, and GEC.

The first three are called "close voicings" because the notes are as close together as possible. The others are called "spread voicings" or "drop chord voicings" because one of the notes (voices) is moved to a different octave and is no longer as close as possible to the others.

ECG is a spread voicing, for example, because there is another G in between E and C that is skipped over (the G in the chord is in a higher octave than the E). The E that was previously between the C and G in root position was "dropped" an octave. On the fretboard, you can only play a spread voicing by skipping at least one string. Only close voicings are playable on three adjacent strings.

We will limit ourselves to close voicings for the remainder of this page.

The three close voicings for C Major are:

* CEG (root inversion)

* EGC (1st inversion)

* GCE (2nd inversion)

On the top three strings of the fretboard, they look like this:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/C-Major-Inversions.png" title="C Major triads, all close-voiced inversions on G/B/E" >}}
</div>

Notice that when moving up the neck to the next inversion, each "voice" in the triad (lowest, middle, or highest pitch) moves up to the next higher note. C (root) moves to E (M3), E moves to G (p5), and G moves to C (root). CEG &rarr; EGC. The same thing going from first to second inversion: EGC &rarr; GCE. And again when repeating the next higher root inversion (at frets 15-17 if you can reach): GCE &rarr; CEG.

These three shapes allow you to play **any** major chord! If you move these three shapes two frets higher, they form D Major (the notes D, F&sharp;, and A).

It's very important to remember where the root note is in each of these shapes. In practice, you'll often find yourself forming these shapes around a given note. If you want to play G major, for example, you can choose between the G at the 12th fret 3rd string, 8th fret of the B string, or 3rd fret of the E string. It's then just a matter of forming the shape appropriate for the root on that string.

<div class="bg-info">
<p>
  We are going to find and play all 12 Major triads on the top three strings, in every inversion, by moving through the cycle of fourths.
</p>
<p>
  First find and play the B Major root position triad with the root at fret 6. Then play the 1st inversion B Major with the root at fret 7, then 2nd inversion with the root at fret 12. Continue up the neck as high as you can reach comfortably, e.g. the root position triad at frets 16-18 if you can reach.
</p>
<p>
  Next find all the close-voiced E Major triads on the top three strings. Then all the A Major triads.
</p>
<p>
  Continue through the entire cycle of fourths: B E A D G C F B&flat; E&flat; A&flat; D&flat; G&flat;, and then back to B where the cycle repeats.
</p>
<p>
  As you progress through the cycle of fourths, always start with the lowest triad you can find on the top three strings (the inversion closest to the nut). Try <em>not</em> to always start with the same inversion.
</p>
<p>
  Trying to find the lowest triad may seem difficult at first. Just remember the open strings are G, B, and E. Whatever note you're looking for is going to be within a few frets of one of those notes. Sometimes the inversion you first consider needs (imaginary) notes below the open strings. Since you can't play imaginary notes, visualize the next inversion higher than the one you imagined first, and play that.
</p>
<p>
  You'll likely find this exercise quite difficult at first. Don't even attempt it until you are confident that you <a href="{{< ref "/page/1-just-12-notes.md" >}}"><strong>KNOW</strong> the notes on the fretboard.</a> It's sufficiently difficult that you'll probably want to avoid performing this exercise with a metronome for quite a while. Wait until you are quite confident you can find all the triads quickly before even attempting to use a metronome.
</p>
<p>
  You can be <em>very</em> confident that you know the top three strings of the fretboard well if you can perform this exercise with a metronome, playing whole notes at, say, 60 BPM.

Next up are minor triads. As we discussed, minor triads are formed by flattening the 3rd:

Diminished and augmented triads are used far less frequently than Major/minor, but they are still very much worth learning.

The diminished triad is part of diatonic harmony. A diminished triad is formed by stacking thirds beginning on the 7th scale degree. When harmonizing the C Major scale, the seventh scale degree is the note B. The notes B, D, and F (stacked thirds from the scale) form the B diminished triad.

Diminished triads are also useful when playing over dominant seventh chords.  The chord G7, for example comprises the notes G, B, D, and F. Thus a G7 chord "contains" two triads: GBD (G Major triad) and BDF (B dim triad). As weird as it sounds, it's completely legit to think of a B diminished triad as a G7 without the root note! If someone else in the band plays the G note or G Major chord, playing B dim triads will create the dominant 7th sound of a G7.

Next up are the oddest triads of all: augmented triads. Because augmented triads are formed of two stacked M3 intervals, they are completely symmetric. C+ (or "Caug") for example comprises the notes C, E, and G&sharp;. The interval between any pair of notes (C/E, E/G&sharp;, or G&sharp;/C) is a major third. This creates a surprising result when you look at it on the fretboard:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/C-aug-Inversions.png" title="C augmented triads, all close-voiced inversions on G/B/E" >}}
</div>

All the shapes are the same! Isn't that weird?

This means that although there are technically only four different augmented triads, not twelve. The left-most shape above with the notes C/E/G&sharp; can be considered one of *three different* augmented triads:

* C+ (root inversion)

* E+ (2nd inversion)

* G&sharp;+ (1st inversion)

Which one you call it depends on the current context.

  Repeat Exercise 1, but this time use augmented triads instead of Major triads. Because the shape never changes, only the position, you should find this one relatively easy.
