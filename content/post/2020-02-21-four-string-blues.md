When soloing or playing with a band, it's often helpful to avoid the lowest two strings. Those lower registers are where the bass player and the rest of the band tend to hang out.

The blues uses dominant seventh chords (with extensions and alterations) almost exclusively. Just as with triads, it's useful to spend a lot of time with seventh chords that only use the top four strings.

Seventh chords, four-note chords, can be inverted exactly like triads. Because there are four unique notes in a seventh chord, however, you end up with **four** inversions, not just three like you do with triads.

## Example: C7 (root inversion)

C7, for example, is spelled C, E, G, B&flat;. Playing those notes in order on the fretboard would look like this:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/4-string-blues/C7-root-unplayable.png" title="C7 Root Inversion" width="33%" >}}

That's a pretty big stretch, though, and hard to actually play in practice. So let's re-order the higher notes to make it easier to finger. Instead of playing Root, 3rd, 5th, &flat;7th, we will reorder it and play Root, 5th, &flat;7th, 3rd:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/4-string-blues/C7-root.png" title="C7 Root Inversion" width="33%" >}}

You should find that much easier to play.

This still has the root note, C, as the lowest note, so we'll still call it the "root inversion" even though the remaining notes aren't played in order. Any shape with C in the bass is still called a "root inversion" of C7.

## Remaining inversions of C7

To find the next inversion, we raise each note to the next one in the chord. The root is raised to the 3rd, the 3rd to the 5th, and the 5th to the &flat;7. Using note names, instead of C/G/B&flat;/E, we play E/B&flat;/C/G:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/4-string-blues/C7-1st-inv-high.png" title="C7 First Inversion" width="33%" >}}

Let's move that down an octave onto lower frets so we can continue:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/4-string-blues/C7-1st-inv.png" title="C7 First Inversion (on lower frets)" width="33%" >}}

Now repeat the process of raising each note successively to find the second inversion:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/4-string-blues/C7-2nd-inv.png" title="C7 Second Inversion " width="33%" >}}

And again to find the 3rd inversion:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/4-string-blues/C7-3rd-inv.png" title="C7 Third Inversion " width="33%" >}}

## Using these shapes

Now it's worth knowing how we found all four of those inversions, but, in practice, most normal people just memorize the four shapes. It's good practice (and mentally challenging) to try raising each note individually in order like this, but when actually playing music you'll need to have the shapes already memorized in order to play fluidly and in time.

This "raise each note" trick to find inversions works with **any** chord shape, by the way, with any number of notes. If you are looking to find new chord shapes to play over a familiar tune, take a chord you already know and raise each note up to the next note in the chord. Voil√† &mdash; a new voicing of the same chord. Try it!

Let's get back to the blues and dominant seventh chords, though. Here are all four inversions shown on the complete fretboard:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/4-string-blues/C7-all.png" title="C7 All Inversions" width="33%" >}}

Notice that the root note only exists in one location within each inversion (of course, since we're only playing 4-note shapes). Since you've already memorized the notes everywhere on the fretboard (right?!! :-) it should now be easy to find dominant 7 chord shapes anywhere on the fretboard!

### Finding dom7 chord shapes

Let's say your fretting hand is somewhere around the 5th fret and you want to play a G7 chord. You **KNOW** the note at the 5th fret of the D string is a G, so you should be able to quickly find this G7 chord right under your fingers:

{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/4-string-blues/G7-root.png" title="G7 at 5th Fret" width="33%" >}}

### Practice drills

The first step is simply to practice forming all four shapes. First practice forming and moving between all four shapes rubato (out of time). Play the chord, then just hit the root note. Keep moving between all four shapes.

Start with C7 as diagramed above, then practice in every natural key by ascending in 4ths. After you get comfortable moving between all the C7s, find all four F7s, then all four B7s, then E7, A7, D7, and finally G7.

This will be **hard** at first, but it gets easier. You'll quickly discover two ways to find the chords:

* **Dead Reckoning**: First find the root on one of the top four strings, then form the appropriate chord shape around that note.

* **Pilotage**: Starting with a shape you know, form the next shape higher or lower on the fretboard. The shapes always proceed in the same order.

You'll quickly become proficient with both techniques if you keep at it.

#### Practicing with the blues

The next step is to practice moving between dom7 chords over a 12 bar blues progression. Either find or create a 12 bar blues backing track ([iReal Pro](https://irealpro.com) is **great** for this!) and practice forming these four shapes over the progression.

The goal is three-fold:

1. To work on your **timing** and **groove**. It's important to practice playing in time.

2. To train your ears to start hearing the chord changes. Believe it or not, your ears are already trained to hear the changes &mdash; you've been hearing the 12 bar blues progression since you were a small child (whether you realized it or not). Your subconscious already recognizes the movement from the I7 to the IV7, and the turnaround from the V7 to the IV7 to the I7. The trick is to move this to your **conscious** mind.

3. To improve your fretboard visualization, and learn to "see" the chord shapes (and scale shapes) on the fretboard as the changes occur.

The first step is to get used to hearing the *backbeat** in 4/4 time (by **far** the most common time signature in all forms of western music).

This drill doesn't even use your guitar. Put your metronome at a nice slow tempo (like 50 BPM) and learn to hear the clicks as beats two and four. Listen to the clicks for a bit, then count out: One ... Two, ..., One, two, three, four.

You've probably heard this a million times before as live bands get started on songs: "Uh one ... two ... uh one two three four, (band starts playing)". Confusingly, the first two counts are **half time**. That is, the first time you hear the word "two" it's actually on beat three! This is an extremely common way of counting in a song, though.

This guy, for example, seems to have known what he was doing:

One of the best ways to practice is with a metronome with clicks only on two and four. As silly as it may seem, this isn't as easy as it sounds. Here's a five minute video of me trying to explain the process:
