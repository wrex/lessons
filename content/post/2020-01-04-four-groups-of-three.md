This is a follow-on to my last post about connecting pentatonic shapes, and part of my never ending quest to really learn how to solo.

As we've discussed, the goal isn't to learn one or more "shapes" on the fretboard for a pentatonic scale. The goal is to be able to play the five notes of the pentatonic scale **anywhere** on the fretboard, instantly and effortlessly.

Eventually, you want to be able to "see" a chord/arpeggio shape in your mind's eye someplace close to where your left hand currently resides. Once you "see" this shape, you should instantly and effortlessly "see" the pentatonic scale shapes that hang off this chord both lower and higher on the neck.

It's impossible to accomplish this goal without a methodical practice regimen. What follows is the regimen I'm currently following myself:

Step 1 is to learn the major and minor triad shapes on the top four strings. I've covered triads exhaustively in the resources section of this site (see {{< ref "/page/1-triads.md" >}}). While it's good to learn everything eventually, I recommend ignoring diminished and augmented triads, and to focus on just the top four strings at first.

Step 2 is to learn the five pentatonic shapes and how they connect. That's what this post is about.

Let's start with the three shapes of the Am pentatonic scale we showed last time:
