This is a follow-on to my last post about connecting pentatonic shapes, and part of my never ending quest to really learn how to solo.

As always, the goal is to play music (sounds) not memorize shapes or terminology.  Specifically, we want to be able to play the five notes of the pentatonic scale, instantly and effortlessly.

It's all too easy to get so wrapped up in theory and names and the **analytical, verbal, mentally straining** aspects of music that you lose sight of the goal (believe me, I have this problem in spades).

Ideally, you only want to think in terms of sounds while playing music. You want your fingers to automatically know where to go when you think of the sound you want to make. You'll get there sooner than you might think if you keep practicing, and it's a *very* cool feeling when your fingers just seem to automagically know where to go.

In the interim, though, its better to use *visual* and tactile cues (shapes) rather than linguistic/analytical cues (names and terminology from music theory). Using visual shapes and tactile grips to pull things out of your memory is much easier than using more verbal/analytical things like "box 4 of the minor pentatonic scale".

Visual/tactile cues are easier on your brain. It's why we often describe music with terms like colors and textures.

Theory and terminology are useful for preparation, organizing your thoughts, learning, exploring, and communicating with others, but thinking about theory and names just gets in the way while actually *playing* music.

Specifically, this post is about using chord shapes to recall entire pentatonic scale shapes, rather than the abstract names for the patterns. The term "box 4," for example, has no musical meaning so using that name to recall the shape isn't as useful to me as "seeing" the minor chord shape within the pattern as my index into the shape when dredging it up from memory.

What follows is a visual, shape-based practice regimen for learning the pentatonic scale that I'm currently following myself. I've found it has improved my playing dramatically.

### Prerequisites to **KNOWING** the pentatonic scale

The first pre-requisite is to [learn the note names everywhere on the fretboard]({{< ref "/page/1-just-12-notes.md" >}}). It isn't quite necessary to completely **KNOW** the entire fretboard, but you should be able to find any natural note (A, B, C, D, E, F, or G) on the top three strings quickly and without too much effort before proceeding.

The second pre-requisite is to learn the major and minor triad shapes on the top **four** strings (we will be using 4-string chord shapes that have the same note on the D and E strings â€” octave drop shapes). I've covered triads exhaustively in the [resources section of this site]({{< ref "/page/1-triads.md" >}}). While it's good to learn everything eventually, I recommend ignoring diminished and augmented triads for now, and just focusing on major and minor triads on the top four strings at first.

Instead of triads, some people prefer to think in terms of full six string CAGED shapes. There is nothing wrong with this, but since solos usually use notes up on the thinner strings, I prefer triads on those strings rather than full barre chords that are rooted on the fifth and sixth strings.

CAGED also focuses primarily on major chord shapes. Minor chords are possibly even more important when it comes to pentatonic scales since the minor pentatonic scale is commonly used over both major and minor chord progressions, but the opposite is not true (the major pentatonic scale will usually sound awful over minor chords).

Regardless, you should be able to easily play major and minor triads for any natural root note (ABCDEFG) on the top four strings (DGBE) before continuing.

<p>
  Even though we'll be using the top four strings to form chords below, it's not as important to know the note on the D string as it is on the top three strings. This is because the chord shapes we use double the same note on the lowest (D) and highest (E) strings. Therefore we only need to practice finding notes on the top three strings.
</p>
<p>
   Start with minor chords. Work through the short cycle-of-fourths (BEADGCF) in order. For each note, find the minor triad inversion on the GBE strings as low on the neck as possible. Then find the note from the E string an octave lower on the D string, then play and memorize that 4-string shape.
</p>
<p>
  Let's say you're on the note B. You first need to find the note B as low on the neck as possible. The open B string doesn't work, because the remainder of the B minor triad (the note B D F&sharp;) with the root on the second string needs notes below the nut. So the lowest place to find a triad on the neck is the root inversion with the B on the G string at the 4th fret. Now double the F&sharp; on the E string an octave lower on the D string at the 4th fret. Play and memorize this four string shape while saying "B minor".
</p>
<p>
  Next find the next Bm inversion up higher on the neck and repeat the process. Continue finding inversions as high up on the neck as you can comfortably reach. There are only three unique 4-string triad shapes for each root note, but you should be able to reach at least four different positions on the neck (on an electric guitar).
</p>
<p>
  Once you've found all three shapes in different places on the neck, practice moving between them quickly, jumping around at random. Try to "see" the root notes in each position and use them to navigate.
</p>
<p>
  Now repeat the process with the rest of the natural notes, proceeding through the cycle of fourths.

### Learning the pentatonic shapes

Note that I call these "the" pentatonic shapes, with no distinction between major and minor shapes. There are only five shapes, and each one can be either major or minor depending how you use them.

The notes in Am pentatonic are A, C, D, E, and G. These are the *same* notes as C Major pentatonic (C, D, E, G, and A) but each note sounds and functions differently depending on the harmonic context. "Harmonic context" just means what chords are playing in the background, or which note "feels" like the root note (home base).

If chord you play over is Am, and/or the phrases you create with those five notes end on and emphasize the note A, the melody will sound wistful and sad (or "minor").

If your play over C Major or the phrases end on and emphasize C, the melody will sound sweet and happy ("major").

Enough talk!

Let's first look at the five notes in Am pentatonic all over the neck:

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-wholeneck.png" title="Am Pentatonic, whole neck" >}}
</div>

This diagram for is intractably complex and way too much to keep in our memory in one chunk. We need to break it down into smaller, more tractable pieces.

Notice first that if we start on any A, we can find a C either three frets higher on the same string, or two frets **lower** on the next string (remember the fret shift when moving between string 3 and string 2, however).

#### Step 3a: Two one-octave shapes

We can use this fact to first memorize two simple one-octave shapes (similar to what I called the "frying pan" shapes in [another set of posts]({{< ref "/post/2018-12-18-the-frying-pan.md" >}})):

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/two-one-octave-Am-1.png" title="One octave Am Pentatonic, shape 1" width="33%">}}
</div>

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/two-one-octave-Am-2.png" title="One octave Am Pentatonic, shape 2" width="33%">}}
</div>

You want to program your fingers to play these shapes without conscious effort.

Note that shape 1 starts with your *first* finger on the root note, and the remaining notes on the same or *higher* frets.

Shape 2 has your *pinky* on the root note, and the remaining notes *lower* on the neck.

You can use this fact to great advantage: The note you're looking for is almost guaranteed to be close to one of those two fingers. You shouldn't need to move your left hand very far up or down the neck to get one of those two fingers in position.

Watch the pros and notice how efficiently they move their hands. Their hands always seem to be in the right place for the notes they want to play.

<div class="bg-info">
  <p>
    First play the Am pentatonic scale using the one octave shape 1, starting on the A on the sixth string as shown above. Play it straight up and down until your fingers automatically know where to go. Thinking in terms of fingers, the pattern is 1-4, 1-3, 1-(3). You can either end on the root note in the higher octave, or just go back down the scale. Practice it ascending and descending. <strong>SEE</strong> the pattern in your mind's eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, start with your first finger on an A on different strings (e.g. the A on the 12th fret of the 5th string). Remember to shift the pattern by a fret when moving between the 3rd and 2nd strings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, play the pentatonic shape in other keys by starting on notes other than an A. For example, go through the circle of fourths: first find all the one-octave B pentatonic shapes (shape 1), then all the E's, then A, D, G, C, F. This should be easy, but that doesn't mean you should skip the exercise. You are programming your brain and finger connections: think "Bm pentatonic" and your pointer finger on your left hand should **automatically** move to a nearby B note and start that pattern.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perform these exercises over a backing track (just a looped minor chord suffices) to get the sound of the scale in your ear.

  <p>
    First play the Am pentatonic scale on string six as we did in exercise 1, but this time use shape 2 instead. Again, play it straight up and down until your fingers automatically know where to go. Thinking in terms of fingers, the pattern is 4, 2-3, 1-4, (1). You can either end on the root note in the higher octave, or just go back down the scale. Practice it ascending and descending. **SEE** the pattern in your mind's eye.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, try different strings (e.g. the A on the 12th fret of the 5th string). Remember to shift the pattern by a fret when moving between the 3rd and 2nd strings. Also practice with different keys (different starting notes other than A). Be sure you know what minor key you are playing each time!
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, practice finding a note on any string and playing both patterns, starting with your index finger or pinky as appropriate. Notice how little your hand needs to move when you have the option of starting with either finger!
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, practice as much as possible with a looper or backing track to internalize the sound of the scale in a harmonic context.
  </p>

Now take a look at "pattern 1" of the Am pentatonic again (repeated here for convenience):

<div class="text-center">
{{< figure src="/img/neck-diagrams/Am-position1-degree1.png" title="Am Pentatonic, pattern 1" >}}
</div>

Notice that this multi-octave pattern has both one octave shapes within it. It starts with the one-octave shape 1 pattern, then continues with shape 2 (again with a one fret shift on the second string). Then it starts over again with shape 1 on the first string, then we run out of strings.

**All** of the pentatonic shapes work the same way. They are all just combinations of the one-octave shapes!

### Multi-octave shapes

Learning the two one octave pentatonic patterns (AKA [the frying pan]({{< ref "/post/2018-12-18-the-frying-pan.md" >}})) is pretty easy and fun, and shouldn't take you more than a single practice session to learn.

Unfortunately, there are **five** different multi-octave shapes, each starting on a different note in the lowest position. Learning all five multi-octave shapes takes a bit more effort. Expect to spend about a week or two of daily practice just to memorize all five shapes. Mastery will take months at least, but simple memorization of the patterns shouldn't take more than a week or two.

Sadly, even *naming* these five shapes is an utter pain for a number of reasons.

The most common naming is based on the lowest note in the shape. For example, the  diagram above is labeled "pattern 1" since the lowest note in the shape is the root or first note in the scale. The next shape higher on the neck would be called "pattern 2" since it starts with the note C, the 2nd note in the scale. The problem with this is that "Am pattern 1" is **the same shape** as "C Major pattern 5" (since A is the 5th note in the C Major pentatonic scale, but the first note in Am).

I find it confusing to have two names for the same shape. I know A and C are different notes (and I even **KNOW** everywhere they both can be found everywhere on the fretboard!).

Even worse, expending mental energy remembering two names for the same shape makes playing music even harder.

In practice, most people **don't** think about shape *names* when soloing (their brains are too busy thinking about the *sounds* of chords, arpeggios, and scales). Again, the verbal/analytical part of your brain mostly shuts down when improvising.

#### How to think about scale shapes while playing

Instead of thinking "pattern 1" or "box 4," most people first "see" (in their mind's eye) a minor chord/arpeggio nearby on the fretboard. They then use that chord shape as the index or hook into their memory, dredging up the scale shape that overlays the notes of that chord. It's a visual, pattern based recall, not a linguistic lookup going on in their head. The visual shape on the fretboard and visceral feel of the chord under their fingers is the index, not the verbal name of the shape.

Because solos are mostly played with higher pitched notes, I think it's helpful to "see" chord shapes on the thinnest strings. Instead of thinking about giant five or six string barre chords rooted on the sixth or fifth strings, it seems better to "see" triad shapes on the top three or four strings.

#### Step 3b: Memorize each multi-octave pattern individually

Below are the five individual multi-octave boxes or patterns of the pentatonic scale.

The leftmost diagram in each set is the basic shape of the box, with the "blue note" indicated as a blue triangle. Note that the blue note is the &flat;5 in a minor context, but the &flat;3 in a major context. Either way, the location of the blue note is the same in either context! You can safely ignore the blue note when first memorizing the patterns, but eventually you'll cherish the extra spice those notes provide.

The second and third diagrams show where minor and major triads appear on the top four strings within the scale shape. Notice that each box shape contains *both* major and minor triads! The same box can be major or minor depending on which notes are emphasized.

Note that the box diagrams don't indicate the root note because that depends on context! The root notes are shown in red in the major/minor diagrams.

It may seem weird to call four note chord shapes "triads," but each shape only contains three unique notes. With four strings, one of the notes within the triad gets doubled (this should be familiar if you practiced your ["octave drop" drills]({{< ref "/page/triads-2-dropstrings.md" >}})).

The minor triad shapes in boxes 3 and 5 don't fall completely within the basic scale shapes. As we'll see, this is actually a good thing since we'll eventually start connecting these boxes together.

<div class="bg-info">
  <p>
    First play the "box 1" shape at the fifth fret straight up and down, from the lowest note to the highest, and then back down. The blue notes are optional. Repeat until you're confident you've got the position of every note memorized. Refer to the diagram as necessary, but try to memorize the shape as quickly as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    At this point, these are just notes without context. Because so many solos use the minor pentatonic sound (SO ... MANY ... SOLOS!) you are probably hearing a minor sound, but let's really hammer home a minor context.
  </p>
  <p>
    Play the minor triad for box 1 shown above at the fifth fret (an Am). Keep strumming until you've got the sound of the chord in your head. Now slowly play some "lines" with the box 1 shape, going up and down but starting on different notes and varying the rhythm.
  </p>
  <p>
    Close your eyes as you alternate between playing the Am chord and the notes of the scale. You should notice that your head and ears want to linger on the A notes (the red notes in the diagram). If you really pay attention, you'll notice that the p5 note (E) gives almost as much a sense of resolution as the root, but while the &flat;3 and &flat;7 notes sound like they belong, they aren't quite as resolved. The blue note should sound particularly spicy &mdash; you'll not want to end a phrase on the blue note, it needs to go somewhere, but short passing phrases using the blue note will sound exquisite!
  </p>
  <p>
    Okay, now let's cleanse the palate and move our ears to a major context. First strum the major triad indicated in the Box 1 diagram at the <strong>2nd</strong> fret (this will be an A <strong>Major</strong> chord). You may recognize this as the G shape from the CAGED system. (If you played the shape at the fifth fret you would be playing a C Major chord. For now we want to keep the same root note, and just change the quality of the harmony from minor to major.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, switch between playing the chord and slowly progressing through notes within the shape. Do you hear how different things sound now? The same shape (in a different position on the neck) now sounds ... sweeter, happier. You should still find yourself wanting to resolve to the A notes again, but now they are in different locations.
  </p>
  <p>
    To have some real fun, record a loop of yourself just strumming simple A5 power chords with any rhythm you like.
  </p>
