I made a conscious decision early in my guitar studies to focus on the blues. Much of the music I liked was based on the form, so it seemed like a great place to start. It seems pretty funny to me now, but I also truly believed that the blues were a nice "simple" place to start. I've since learned just how wrong I was about "simple."

It's true that the basic structure of the 12-bar blues form is pretty straightforward: It's just three chords! Then you start to notice some oddities. Like: All three chords are dominant sevenths. How and why does that work? Traditional theory says only the V7 chord is dominant. Why does the blues form also use I7 and IV7?

(Theorists would say weird things like: "Because the I7 is the V7 of the IV" and "The b3 and b7 notes can also be considered borrowed from the parallel minor scales." Blues musicians would say "because it sounds good.")

In hindsight, I wish that, like my father, I had really been into simple 3-chord hillbilly songs. About the only thing I got right about the blues being "simple" was that the chord changes are generally pretty consistent and predictable (unless you happen to like, say, <a href="https://flypaper.soundfly.com/features/understanding-advanced-blues-harmony/">Brian Wilson or Ornette Coleman</a>.

From the start, I wanted to be able to solo and vamp freely over what other musicians were playing. I wanted to be able to play "what I feel". I (correctly) thought that this would be easier if I knew what chord changes were coming and when. Since the 12-bar blues form has a fairly standard structure, what better place to start?

That part I got right, and if I'd stayed with simple forms my road would probably have been a lot easier. Unfortunately, the music I liked best tended to be the most complex. I spent years chasing things way beyond my capabilities, long before I got the basic, simple stuff down.

Don't follow my path. I **strongly** encourage you to keep things as simple as possible for as long as possible. Wait until you have truly nailed the fundamentals before moving on. (I keep telling myself this even now.)

Nail the **fundamentals** before moving onto more complex studies.

### Rhythm: Swung Eighths

The first and most important fundamental for **any** music (not just blues, IMHO) is *rhythm*.

You can get away with murder with muffled or wrong notes and chords, as long as you've nailed the rhythm. The opposite is definitely not true, however: even absolute perfect melody/harmony/articulation sounds *awful* if the rhythm is off.

The fundamental rhythmic groove of the blues is based on triplets and swung eighths.

"**Straight eighths**" are more common in rock and other music. Straight eighths sound like:

**One**-and **two**-and **three**-and **four**-and

with equal spacing between each pulse (downbeat or "and"). A blues progression with a fast straight eighths groove immediately sounds rock-and-roll (tap along to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZFo8-JqzSCM" target="_blank">Johnny B. Goode by Chuck Berry</a>, for example).

**Triplets** have three pulses per beat:

**One**-and-a **two**-and-a **three**-and-a **four**-and-a

Again, equal spacing between each of the pulses (downbeat, "and," or "a") but triplets come in groups of three rather than two. An example of the triplet feel is <a href="https://youtu.be/bQQCPrwKzdo" target="_blank">Blueberry Hill by Fats Domino</a> (listen to the drummer playing the hi-hat &mdash; those are triplets).

"**Swung eighths**" are kind of like triplets, but without the middle pulse:

**one**-...-a   **two**-...-a   **three**-...-a   **four**-...-a

The spacing is unequal. There is a longer pause between the downbeat and the upbeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/ejr2S7bN0V8?&t=3m22s" target="_blank">Matt Smith describes the sound as the "clip-clop" of horses in old western movies</a>. Some people also call it the "flat tire" rhythm because of the uneven sound of a punctured tire rolling around the rim. A classic example of the swung eighth groove is <a href="https://youtu.be/INniLPDgQRU" target="_blank">Jimi Hendrix playing Red House</a> (again, pay particular attention to the drums to hear the rhythm &mdash; a mix of triplets and swung eighths).

Before studying anything else with the blues, it's important to practice actually playing swung eighths *with a metronome*. I'd recommend spending at least a few **hours** if not days just practicing this rhythm until it is completely ingrained and automatic.

Modern blues tends to emphasize the backbeats. In slower tempos, the backbeats are the "ands" (or "a's") rather than the downbeats. At faster tempos, it's beats two and four. Simply emphasizing the backbeat can dramatically improve the overall sound of the progression.

### Not losing your place within 12 bars

Even though the basic 12-bar blues has a simple structure, and the chords almost always come in the same place, that doesn't mean it isn't easy to get lost.

Personally, I found it incredibly easy to get lost while I was playing. I was using so much mental capacity performing whatever I was doing (remembering chords, licks, tricky rhythms, whatever) that I lost place within the progression. Wait, is this bar 4 or bar 8?

When you lose your place in a band situation, it's almost always best to just **take your hands off the guitar** and wait a few measures until you are certain where you are before picking up again. Silence will invariably sound better than something flat wrong.

The only way to avoid getting lost at all is to practice the progression so many times that it becomes subconscious. It's also important to eliminate any unnecessary complexity and just focus on the progression until you hear it in your sleep.

Before studying anything else with the blues, I strongly recommend putting in some serious practice on just these two elements: the swung eighth rhythm, and starting to hear and anticipate the changes in the chord progression.
