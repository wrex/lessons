Okay, let's finish off the rest of this classic song. First up is the intro, which uses a pretty cool dom7 voicing on the top four strings.

As before, I'm documenting the song in the key of G (though it's played in A on the record).

The intro starts with a turnaround as four pickup bars: a bar of D7, then a bar of C7, a bar of G7, and finally a bar of D9 in straight eighths. Then you are back at the top and ready to start the song for real.

Here are the only two chord shapes used for the intro:

Note the optional note on the E string (the A or P5) in the D9 shape. To my ear it sounds like Hubert only plays the inner four strings.

So to play the intro, first play a bar of D7 as shown. Then move the same shape down two frets (to the 8th fret) to play C7. Next, bring it all the way down to the 3rd fret, and you've got a G7. Finish up with a bar of D9 played in straight eighths. Voilà! You've just played the complete intro.

As demonstrated in the following video, the hard part is getting the rhythm right and muting the unused strings. One thing that helps with the rhythm is to *keep that right hand moving*. The song does **not** need to be played cleanly, but it does need to *groove*.
