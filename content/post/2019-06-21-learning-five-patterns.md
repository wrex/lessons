Here is a 29 minute exercise and a tracking system I use to learn, **REALLY** learn, the five pentatonic shapes. You probably won't be able to complete the entire exercise the first time you try it, but the tracking system ensures you will continue to make progress. After several days or weeks practicing this one exercise, you'll be able to effortlessly find the closest pentatonic scale shape anywhere on the neck.

## Why yet another drill on the same topic?!!

I created this exercise and system to answer "what should I practice now?".

Even though I "knew" the five pentatonic shapes, I knew I needed more fluency seeing the shapes in different keys, how they connected, the chord shapes they relate to, etc. I needed a practice regimen that would force me to methodically work on all five positions in different keys, until I could effortlessly find my way around in any key, anywhere on the keyboard.

It's hard enough to even find any time to practice, so it's particularly painful to waste valuable practice time either repeating stuff you've already perfected, or paralyzed trying to figure out what to work on next.

We all want spoon-feeding. We secretly wish for an instructor who is instantly available and looking over our shoulder whenever we have a few minutes free to practice. We want someone who will tell us exactly which exercise we should be practicing and when (like our elementary school teachers used to do).

Unfortunately, none of us have an instructor with us at every practice session. Everyone must devise their own system for figuring out what to work on and how to track progress.

This is the exercise and tracking system I created for working on pentatonic scales. Hopefully it will give you ideas for how to create practice regimens for other topics as well.

## The system

For the next several days or weeks, open your practice log and create a grid with three columns and five rows in today's entry. I strongly recommend starting in the key of Am and sticking with just that one key for at least a few weeks. The pentatonic scale in the key of Am is the notes A, C, D, E, and G.

In the first column, you write the position number and lowest note in that position. The other two columns are for tic marks as you complete portions of the exercise.

After the first day, the grid might look like this (assuming you didn't complete every part of the exercise):

<p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>1: A</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2: C</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3: D</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4: E</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5: G</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</p>

The exercise is as follows:

<ol>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>Row one says to work on position one, which begins with A on the lowest string. First spend one full minute (with a timer!) re-familiarizing yourself with the shape. Play position one up and down, starting and ending on the root note.</p>
        <p>Next find and play all the root notes in the position (there are three of them in position one). [Optional: Find and play A chords (minor and major) near the shape.]</p>
        <p>After the minute is up, tic the middle box in the top row.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now spend an additional minute just playing position one straight up and down, from the lowest note to the highest. Since we are only trying to memorize the shapes, it isn't necessary to use a metronome (but it never hurts!).</p>
        <p>After the minute is up check the rightmost box in the top row.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>This row says to work on position two. Spend another full minute re-familiarizing yourself with this shape. Again, first play it starting and ending on a root note. Practice starting on each root note, going in both directions. Optionally find nearby A chords.</p>
        <p>Tic the box when the minute is up.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We will now spend <strong>three</strong> full minutes working on connecting positions one and two. Each time you start another row, add an additional two minutes to the "b" part of the exercise.</p>
        <p>Start with the lowest note in position one, then ascend through all the notes in the position. Then slide up to position two on the highest string and **descend** through that position. Then slide down to position one and repeat. After a few cycles, reverse direction. Tic the remaining box on row two when the three minutes are up.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>One minute reviewing position three.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Five</strong> minutes connecting positions one, two, and three. First up one, down two, up three, down two, up one, etc. Then reverse direction: down one, up two, down three, up two, ....</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>One minute reviewing position four.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Seven</strong> minutes connecting positions one, two, three, and four.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>One minute reviewing position five.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Nine</strong> minutes connecting all five positions, up and down.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

When first starting out you'll probably find you can't get through all five positions without exploding your brain. That's perfectly okay. Just tic off the boxes you do complete so you can track your progress.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not start with position one every day.

Always start with a different position in the top row each day. This will ensure you spend equal time with every position, even if you don't complete the exercise each day.

For example, if you had position one in the top row on the first day, start with position two on day two, and so on.

This is an important practicing principle, whether you are practicing an exercise or trying to learn a song: if you always start at the same point you will get really, really good at the beginning bits but will invariably fall apart toward the end because you've practiced it so much less. Far better (and faster!) to always start at a different point, even if you haven't yet mastered the beginning.

## Further practice

Once you've mastered Am pentatonic, spend the next several days or weeks working on the Am blues scale (A, C, D, E&flat;, E, G). These correspond to the scale degrees R, 3&flat;, 4, 5, and 7&flat;.

Next start practicing the A **Major** pentatonic scale (A, B, C&sharp, E, F&sharp;) and A **Major** blues scale (A, B, C, C&sharp;, E, F&sharp;). The major pentatonic scale degrees are 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. The "blue note" in the major blues scale is the 3&flat;.
