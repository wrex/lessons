Here is a 29 minute exercise and tracking system to learn, **REALLY** learn, the five pentatonic shapes as quickly as possible.

Sorry for the clickbait headline, but you probably won't be able to complete the entire exercise the first time you try it. It will likely take you at least a few days, but the tracking system ensures you will continue to make progress. After several days or weeks practicing this one exercise, you'll be able to complete the exercise in 29 minutes for real. More importantly, you'll be able to effortlessly find the closest pentatonic scale shape anywhere on the neck.

## Why yet another exercise on the same topic?!!

I wanted to provide a concrete example of how I go about *making efficient progress on a medium-to-long-term goal* (learning all five positions of the pentatonic scale).

We all want spoon-feeding. We secretly wish for an instructor looking over our shoulder every time we have a few minutes free to practice. We want someone who will recognize where we are weak and encourage us to practice what we need most right now (like a good elementary school teacher).

Sadly, there appears to be a scarcity of mind-reading guitar instructors with the patience of an elementary school teacher (that are instantly available 24x7). Instead, we must devise our own systems for figuring out what to work on and how to track progress.

Every day we are swamped with videos, blogs, books, or magazines distracting us with any number of interesting topics that will take ages to learn: scales, chords, arpeggios, songs, techniques etc.

When we actually find time to sit down and practice, especially after a long break, it can be surprisingly hard to figure out what to practice **right now**. What is most important? Where am I weakest? Where did I leave off? It's not at all uncommon to spend the entire practice session just noodling around with stuff you already know as you ponder the question.

[As I've written previously]({{< ref "/post/2019-01-20-practice.md" >}}), even creating your own practice regimen can be surprisingly complex.

My personal practice regimen has evolved, and is now down to just three rules:

1. Maintain a list of the medium-term things you're most interested in learning. They should be things that will take a few days to several months to learn. They don't need to be in any order, and you can replace any item in the list any time you want. Just be sure to limit the list to five items. Post the list prominently in your practice area.

2. Create a system to track progress for any item before you begin working on it. [That's what this post is about.]

3. Maintain a practice log. Every time you sit down to practice, decide which of the five items you want to work on and for how long, and follow the system for each of those items.

It's simple, but it works for me. I feel a lot less overwhelmed about all the things I still need to work on, and less angst about inefficient practice sessions.

The second rule is pretty vague, though. How do you devise a system that ensures you make progress on something without repeating what you already know?

This post presumes one of your medium term goals is to learn all five positions of the pentatonic scale (and that you don't know them already).

There are a million resources all over the internet with diagrams for the five positions (I've included diagrams in the [REFERENCE section below](#reference)) . But those are just tools and information, what we need is a **system**.

What follows is a step by step description of the practice regimen (system) that I'd create to teach myself the five shapes if I didn't already know them.

This is an exhaustive description of something that took me about 5 minutes to create and about two or three sessions to fine-tune. Don't let the length scare you.

## The system

Each day you work on learning the five positions, open your practice log and create a grid with three columns and five rows.

[I strongly recommend starting in the key of Am and sticking with just that one key for at least a few weeks. The pentatonic scale in the key of Am is the notes A, C, D, E, and G.]

In the first column, you write the position number and lowest note in that position. The other two columns are for tic marks as you complete portions of the exercise.

After the first day, the grid might look like this (assuming you didn't complete every part of the exercise):

<p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>1: A</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2: C</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3: D</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
      <td>&#10003;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4: E</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5: G</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</p>

You work through this grid left to right, top to bottom, ticking off boxes as you go.

The first column shows the position number and lowest pitched note in the shape.

The second column is for "1 minute review" of the corresponding position for that row in isolation (just playing it up and down, starting and ending on the lowest pitched root note).

The rightmost column is for "progressive connection drills" (described below â€” these are the meat of the exercise). The box in the upper right gets one minute. Each successive connection drill gets an additional two minutes: One minute for one position, three minutes for connecting two positions, five minutes for three positions, seven minutes for four positions, and a full nine minutes to connect all five positions together.

In gory detail, you'd proceed as follows:

<ol>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>Row one says to work on position one, which begins with A on the lowest string. First spend one full minute (with a timer!) re-familiarizing yourself with the shape. Play position one up and down, starting and ending on the root note.</p>
        <p>Next find and play all the root notes in the position (there are three of them in position one). [Optional: Find and play A chords (minor and major) near the shape.]</p>
        <p>After the minute is up, tic the middle box in the top row.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now spend an additional minute just playing position one straight up and down, from the lowest note to the highest. Since we are only trying to memorize the shapes, it isn't necessary to use a metronome (but it never hurts!).</p>
        <p>After the minute is up check the rightmost box in the top row.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>This row says to work on position two. Spend another full minute re-familiarizing yourself with this shape. Again, first play it starting and ending on a root note. Practice starting on each root note, going in both directions. Optionally find nearby A chords.</p>
        <p>Tic the box when the minute is up.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We will now spend <strong>three</strong> full minutes working on connecting positions one and two. Each time you start another row, add an additional two minutes to the "b" part of the exercise.</p>
        <p>Start with the lowest note in position one, then ascend through all the notes in the position. Then slide up to position two on the highest string and <strong>descend</strong> through that position. Then slide down to position one and repeat. After a few cycles, reverse direction. Tic the remaining box on row two when the three minutes are up.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>One minute reviewing position three.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Five</strong> minutes connecting positions one, two, and three. First up one, down two, up three, down two, up one, etc. Then reverse direction: down one, up two, down three, up two, ....</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>One minute reviewing position four.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Seven</strong> minutes connecting positions one, two, three, and four.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <p>One minute reviewing position five.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Nine</strong> minutes connecting all five positions, up and down.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

When first starting out you'll probably find you can't get through all five positions without exploding your brain. That's perfectly okay. Just tic off the boxes you do complete so you can track your progress.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not start with position one every day.

Always start with a different position in the top row each day. This will ensure you spend equal time with every position, even if you don't complete the exercise each day.

For example, the second day you practice might start with the grid looking like this:

<p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>2: C</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3: D</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4: E</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5: G</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1: A</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</p>

This is an important practicing principle, whether you are practicing an exercise or trying to learn a song: if you always start at the same point you will get really, really good at the beginning bits but will invariably fall apart toward the end because you've practiced it so much less.

Far better (and faster!) to always start at a different point, even if you haven't yet mastered the beginning.

## Further practice

Once you've mastered Am pentatonic, spend the next several days or weeks working on the Am blues scale (A, C, D, E&flat;, E, G). These correspond to the scale degrees R, 3&flat;, 4, 5, and 7&flat;.

Next start practicing the A **Major** pentatonic scale (A, B, C&sharp, E, F&sharp;) and A **Major** blues scale (A, B, C, C&sharp;, E, F&sharp;). The major pentatonic scale degrees are 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. The "blue note" in the major blues scale is the 3&flat;.
