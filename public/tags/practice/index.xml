      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nobody improves without practice, &lt;strong&gt;regular&lt;/strong&gt; practice. But too many people (myself included) unconciously start to dread (and thus avoid) their practice sessions. I believe this happens for just two reasons: &lt;em&gt;motivation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is the fifth and final lesson on learning the notes of the fretboard::
 Just 12 notes. (Background material) Open and E strings Fret 5 and String 5 Octave Shapes Whole Fretboard (this page)  This diagram of all the natural notes should look considerably less intimidating now:
  The natural notes     We&amp;rsquo;ve already drilled extensively on the outside E strings and the A strings, but we still need to learn the remaining notes on the D, G, and B strings.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get a few more notes under our fingers and into our brains.
This is part 3 of 5:
 Just 12 notes. (Background material) Open and E strings Fret 5 and String 5 (this page) Octave Shapes Whole Fretboard  As we described previously, if we KNOW the notes of the open strings and at the 12th fret, it&amp;rsquo;s handy to also KNOW the notes at the 5th fret because it&amp;rsquo;s almost half way between.</description>

      <description>This document presents a number of exercises to learn the names of all the natural notes on the fretboard.
This is part 2 of 5:
 Just 12 notes. (Background material) Open and E strings (this page) Fret 5 and String 5 Octave Shapes Whole Fretboard  Try not to be intimidated, but here is what we are eventually going to learn (this diagram is just for the first 15 frets, but you will learn your entire fretboard).</description>

      <description>This is part 4 of 5 pages dedicated to learning the notes on the fretboard:
 Just 12 notes. (Background material) Open and E strings Fret 5 and String 5 Octave Shapes (this page) Whole Fretboard  Here&amp;rsquo;s the complete diagram of the fretboard again:
  The natural notes     Hopefully it looks a little less intimidating than the first time you saw it.
Now that you already KNOW a bunch of landmarks, it&amp;rsquo;s time to learn a neat little navigational trick called octave shapes to help you (quickly) find the remaining notes by dead reckoning from those landmarks.</description>
