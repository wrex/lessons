      <description>This is part 2 of a 2-part series on triads:
 Triad Introduction Triads on other strings (this page)  Triads exist on more than just the top three strings, of course. The shapes change slightly on each different course of three strings because of the way the guitar is tuned.
The best way to learn these additional shapes is using what Josh at Fretboard Anatomy calls &amp;ldquo;Octave Drop Chord Building.</description>

      <description>This is part 1 of a 2-part series on triads:
 Triad Introduction (this page) Triads on other strings  Chords are just multiple notes played simultaneously. Technically, you can have two-note chords (AKA dyads) but most people consider three-note chords (called &amp;ldquo;triads&amp;rdquo;) to be the simplest possible place to start making real chord harmonies.
Triads are formed by &amp;ldquo;stacking&amp;rdquo; intervals of a minor or major 3rd on top of each other.</description>

      <title>Thoughts About Practice</title>
      <link>https://lessons.doiwalters.com/post/2019-01-20-practice/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nobody improves without practice, &lt;strong&gt;regular&lt;/strong&gt; practice. But too many people (myself included) unconciously start to dread (and thus avoid) their practice sessions. I believe this happens for just two reasons: &lt;em&gt;motivation&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is the fifth and final lesson on learning the notes of the fretboard::
 Just 12 notes. (Background material) Open and E strings Fret 5 and String 5 Octave Shapes Whole Fretboard (this page)  This diagram of all the natural notes should look considerably less intimidating now:
  The natural notes     We&amp;rsquo;ve already drilled extensively on the outside E strings and the A strings, but we still need to learn the remaining notes on the D, G, and B strings.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get a few more notes under our fingers and into our brains.
This is part 3 of 5:
 Just 12 notes. (Background material) Open and E strings Fret 5 and String 5 (this page) Octave Shapes Whole Fretboard  As we described previously, if we KNOW the notes of the open strings and at the 12th fret, it&amp;rsquo;s handy to also KNOW the notes at the 5th fret because it&amp;rsquo;s almost half way between.</description>

      <description>This document presents a number of exercises to learn the names of all the natural notes on the fretboard.
This is part 2 of 5:
 Just 12 notes. (Background material) Open and E strings (this page) Fret 5 and String 5 Octave Shapes Whole Fretboard  Try not to be intimidated, but here is what we are eventually going to learn (this diagram is just for the first 15 frets, but you will learn your entire fretboard).</description>

      <description>This is part 1 of a 5 page tutorial on how to learn the notes on the fretboard:
 Just 12 notes. (Background material — this page) Open and E strings Fret 5 and String 5 Octave Shapes Whole Fretboard  This section is purely background and doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain any exercises.
If you are in a rush and just want to start learning the fretboard, skip this page for now and proceed directly to learning the notes on the open and E strings.</description>

      <title>What About Major?</title>
      <link>https://lessons.doiwalters.com/post/2018-12-29-what-about-major/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hopefully our exploration into minor pentatonic scales wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; exhaustive. We are going to speed up a bit as we delve into the &lt;strong&gt;major&lt;/strong&gt; pentatonic scale. This isn&amp;rsquo;t because it&amp;rsquo;s any less important (far from it) but rather because all of the study methods we&amp;rsquo;ve already covered are equally applicable. It&amp;rsquo;s basically just rinse and repeat, but with a different set of five (or six) notes in a slightly different shape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s wrap up our look at the minor pentatonic scale by looking at some of the &amp;ldquo;between&amp;rdquo; notes, especially the b5 note that lies between the p4 and p5 (known as the &amp;ldquo;blue&amp;rdquo; note).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s continue our discussion about the frying pan shape. Things become even more fun when you realize the same shape exists all over the fretboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post discusses The Frying Pan, which I consider to be the ideal first scale shape for a beginner to study when learning how to solo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What better topic for the first post on my new guitar site?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone who&amp;rsquo;s ever picked up a guitar knows good ole &amp;ldquo;box 1&amp;rdquo; of the Am pentatonic scale. What could possibly be wrong with that as a starting point?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Operator&#39;s Manual for Guitar</title>

      <description>This site&amp;rsquo;s conceit is to take an engineer&amp;rsquo;s approach to teaching the instrument. It attempts to be an &amp;ldquo;Operator&amp;rsquo;s Manual&amp;rdquo; for the guitar, written by an engineer for other engineers.
Engineers can&amp;rsquo;t help themselves from asking &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; at every conceivable step of a learning process. Music is such a deep topic that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lost in the weeds doing this, but the only thing worse to an engineer than not getting an answer is getting a wrong one!</description>

      <description>This is part 4 of 5 pages dedicated to learning the notes on the fretboard:
 Just 12 notes. (Background material) Open and E strings Fret 5 and String 5 Octave Shapes (this page) Whole Fretboard  Here&amp;rsquo;s the complete diagram of the fretboard again:
  The natural notes     Hopefully it looks a little less intimidating than the first time you saw it.
Now that you already KNOW a bunch of landmarks, it&amp;rsquo;s time to learn a neat little navigational trick called octave shapes to help you (quickly) find the remaining notes by dead reckoning from those landmarks.</description>
