<p>This document presents a number of exercises to learn the names of all the natural notes on the fretboard.</p>

<p>This is part 2 of 5:</p>

</ol>

<p>Try not to be intimidated, but here is what we are eventually going to learn (this diagram is just for the first 15 frets, but you will learn your entire fretboard). You&rsquo;ll eventually be able to find and name every single note in this diagram <em>effortlessly</em>:</p>

<p>[If you&rsquo;ve already learned the note locations, by the way, just take a moment to gaze at the ordered complexity of that diagram. Bask in the glory of how much you&rsquo;ve already accomplished. The human brain is amazing. That&rsquo;s quite an accomplishment to learn all that! Learning guitar is <strong>hard</strong> &mdash; it&rsquo;s all too easy to despair. It&rsquo;s important to take a moment periodically and rejoice at how much progress you&rsquo;ve already made. A positive attitude really is important.]</p>

<p>Before you begin, be sure to <strong>tune your guitar</strong> every single time you attempt any of these exercises. These days there is no real excuse for not having some sort of electronic tuner (either a standalone piece of hardware or an app on your phone) but however you do it, be sure your strings are in standard tuning before you do anything else, even if you have to ask a friend to do it for you at first.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to begin training your brain to hear notes in tune. Every time you practice without tuning up, you risk programming your brain with bad information.</p>

<p>Come back to this page and repeat any or all of these exercises as many times as you feel is necessary. Repeat until you are confident you truly <strong>KNOW</strong> the notes.</p>

<p>Feel free to read through all of this before attempting the exercises, but merely reading an exercise is very different from performing it. All of the exercises should be repeated multiple times.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve given little indication of how long each exercise should take or how many times you should repeat it before moving on. Only you will know when you&rsquo;ve truly mastered an exercise. It&rsquo;s pretty normal to get through strings 6 and string 1 in the first day, but you may still find yourself coming back to those exercises occasionally.</p>

<p>The goal is <strong>not</strong> to get through all of this as quickly as possible, it&rsquo;s to truly <strong>KNOW</strong> the fretboard.</p>

<h2 id="open-strings">Open strings</h2>

<p>We number the strings starting from 1, the thinnest string closest to the floor, to 6, the thickest closest to your chin.</p>

<p>Terminology can get confusing, so this site always uses terms like &ldquo;up,&rdquo; &ldquo;down,&rdquo; &ldquo;higher,&rdquo; &ldquo;lower,&rdquo; <em>etc.</em> relative to <strong>pitch</strong> and not relative to physical topology.</p>

<p>That is, the 6th string is <strong>lower</strong> than the 1st string, even though it&rsquo;s physically farther from the floor. Similarly, a note played at the 5th fret is &ldquo;lower down the neck&rdquo; than one played at the 12th fret of the same string, even though proper form has one holding the headstock physically higher than the bridge of the instrument. To play on a lower string means to move your hand further from the floor. To play higher up the neck moves your left hand closer to your right.</p>

<p>From low to high (6th to 1st strings) the strings are tuned to the notes E, A, D, G, B, and E. You simply have to memorize this, there is no shortcut. The E produced by the open 1st string is two octaves higher than the one produced on the open 6th string.</p>

<div class="bg-info">
<h4>Exercise 1: Open strings</h4>

<p>Pluck each string in order, 6, then 5, ..., up to the 1st string, saying the corresponding note name for each string <strong>out loud</strong>. Repeat this multiple times until you are completely confident you've got it memorized. It's important to say the note name out loud, it truly helps your brain to make the connection. This may seem foolishly easy, but things will get much harder quickly &mdash; every second spent ensuring the easy stuff is truly effortless is invaluable.</p>

<p>Now try it going in the other direction, plucking 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5, and finally 6 this time. You may discover you don't know the names as well as you thought. Going backwards can sometimes be surprisingly difficult.</p>

<p>Next, try every other string: 6 4 5 3 4 2 3 1. Then the other direction: 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6. Again, be sure to say the note name <strong>out loud</strong>.</p>

<p>Now try a couple different patterns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sequences of 3 up: 6 5 4, 5 4 3, 4 3 2, 3 2 1, and down: 1 2 3, 2 3 4, 3 4 5, 4 5 6.</li>
  <li>Every other string: 6 4, 5 3, 4 2, 3 1, then 1 3, 2 4, 3 5, 4 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>Out loud, every time.</p>

<p>You probably think this is overkill by now, and that no further drilling is required. Well, there is no better way to prove it to yourself than with a <strong>metronome</strong>. Try setting a metronome to a slow tempo, say 60 BPM, then repeating the previous sequences with one pluck on each beat. Quickly mute each note after you play it, but still saying the note names out loud. If you're at all human, you've probably discovered you didn't know the notes quite as well as you thought.</p>

<p>60 BPM is now easy? Make it harder again by gradually increasing the tempo. Once you can perform the exercise at, say, 100 BPM you can be confident that you truly <strong>KNOW</strong> the open string notes.
</p>

<p>Make sure you practice thinking in both directions, too: from string to name, and from note name to string. That is, sometimes practice plucking a string at random, then naming the note. Other times pick a note from EADGBE at random, then pluck the corresponding string.</p>

</p>

<p>It may seem like incredible overkill to go through all this for something you probably felt you had memorized after reading it once, but trust me that the rigor is worth it.</p>

<p><p></p>
<details><summary>Exercise 2: Notes at the 12th fret (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">
<p>Here's our first free bonus! The notes at the 12th fret are exactly the same as the open strings:</p>

<div class="text-center">
  

<div class="box" style="max-width:33%">
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <div class="img" style="background-image: url('https://lessons.doiwalters.com/img/neck-diagrams/fret-12.png');">
      <img itemprop="thumbnail" src="/img/neck-diagrams/fret-12.png" alt="/img/neck-diagrams/fret-12.png"/>
    </div>
    <a href="/img/neck-diagrams/fret-12.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption><h4>Fret 12 Notes</h4>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p></div></p>

<p>All the notes repeat starting at the 12th fret. Notes at the 12th fret are the same as those at the 0 fret (open strings). Notes at the 13th fret are the same as those at the first fret, and so on.</p>

<p><p>Repeat Exercise 1, but this time use both open strings and the repeated notes at the 12th fret. That is, pluck open 6, open 5, &hellip; open 1, then back down the strings at the 12th fret: 1st string 12th fret, 2nd string 12th fret, and so on. Naming the notes as you go. Then go in the other direction (up the strings at fret 12, down the open strings). Then go through the sequences in both locations and both directions. Check yourself with a metronome.</p>
</div></p>

</details>
</p>

<p>Do it!</p>

<p>Keep drilling until you have absolutely no &ldquo;mental friction&rdquo; or delays. Most people <strong>KNOW</strong> the open notes within just five or ten minutes or so of practice, but don&rsquo;t hesitate to take as long as necessary.</p>

<p>You may think some of these exercies are completely unnecessary, and you may even be right, but it&rsquo;s an extremely bad habit to think you can perform something on the guitar without actually doing it. You may be surprised. You&rsquo;re also programming your brain by associating sounds and fretting locations with note names. Lastly, it&rsquo;s important to spend at least a little time <strong>practicing things you can do easily</strong>. It&rsquo;s easy to become demotivated if you only practice things you <strong>can&rsquo;t</strong> do! (Within moderation, of course, the once you can perform an exercise effortlessly, it&rsquo;s time to move on.)</p>

<p><p></p>
<details><summary>Exercise 3: Reciting the C Major scale (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">
<p>This is an exercise that doesn't even require a guitar.</p>

<p>As stupid as it sounds, the drill is to practice saying the note names in order, <strong>out loud</strong>. Say "C" then "D" then "E" then "F" then "G" then "A" then "B" then repeat the sequence. Get used to going from G to A (there is no note H, so you’ve got to get your brain used to “rolling around” every time you get to G). "C D E F G A B C D E F G A B ...."</p>

<p>Next spend a minute or two starting on random notes: BCDEFGAB, then EFGABCDE, then GABCDEFG, etc. Do it! You need to <strong>KNOW</strong> that the note after G is A (every bit as well as you know that the note after A is B!)</p>

<p>Now we are going to make it a little harder. It’s not enough to know the notes forward, you must also <strong>KNOW</strong> them backwards! Practice, <strong>out loud</strong>, reciting the notes in reverse order (rolling back from A down to G in this case). </p>

<p>You’ll find this a little strange at first, we aren’t used to reciting the alphabet backwards but musicians need to know scales and notes forward, backward, and in arbitrary order! Again, practice starting on any random note and recite the notes backwards: CBAGFEDC, GFEDCBAG, AGFEDCBA, etc. </p>

<p>Do this until it feels natural and automatic, with no thought required. Set a <em>timer</em> and practice going backwards for at least five full minutes. Keep drilling daily until it's as automatic reciting the note that comes before A as it is reciting the note that comes after C.</p>
</div>

</details>
</p>

<p>Do it! No matter how stupid you feel.</p>

<h2 id="the-sixth-string">The sixth string</h2>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got the open strings (and 12th fret) down, let’s learn the seven natural notes on string six. Here’s the complete diagram:</p>

<p>These notes also happen to map to the white keys on a piano. The red C is notated on the staff as &ldquo;middle C&rdquo; on sheet music for guitar, but produces a pitch exactly one octave lower than middle C on a piano.</p>

<p>We’re going to work our way up to memorizing all of these notes incrementally in this section. (Even if this looks somewhat intimidating, it shouldn&rsquo;t take you more than one practice session to <strong>KNOW</strong> (or at least almost <strong>KNOW</strong>) these notes.</p>

<p>Before we tackle learning the notes between the two we already know (the E’s on the open string and fret 12) examine the spacing between each of the labeled notes (the natural notes).</p>

<p>Almost all the notes have two frets (also called a &ldquo;whole step&rdquo;) between them. The only exceptions are between note E and F, and between B and C (with only one fret, or a half step between these pairs of notes). This is important: half steps between B/C and E/F, whole steps everywhere else. Remember this!</p>

<p>The seven natural notes A-G are also known as the C Major scale or &ldquo;C Ionian&rdquo; (which is why the C notes in the diagram are red — C is the root note of the corresponding scale).</p>

<p>If we start from the root C, the pattern of whole steps and half steps is W W h W W W h before we get back to the root again. That is, C to D is a whole step (W), D to E another whole step (W), E to F is only a half step (h), then back to a whole step from F to G, etc.</p>

<p>The diagram stops at fret 15, but the pattern continues indefinitely. Imagine that the diagram is infinitely long, or that fret fifteen wraps back onto fret 3.</p>

<details><summary>Exercise 4: Major Scale Intervals (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">

<p>Memorize this pattern: Whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half. <p>

<p>Recite the "whole whole half whole whole whole half" sequence until you can repeat it in your sleep. <strong>All</strong> of western music derives from this one pattern! Literally recite the sequence out loud for a few minutes ("whole whole half whole whole whole half whole whole half ...")</p>

<p>For the natural notes, the pattern starts with C: C (W) D (W) E (h) F (W) G (W) A (W) B (h) C .... This is the C Major scale. There is a whole step between every pair of notes except B/C and E/F. Remember this!</p>

<p>What's the interval between A and B? Between E and F? Between G and A? Between B and C? Between D and E?</p>

<p>Now consider progressing backwards, <em>down</em> the scale. What is the interval from D down to C? From F down to E? From A down to G?</p>

<p>Practice saying any random note from the seven and answering how large the interval is up and down to the adjacent notes.</p>

<p>Now make it harder and think about the intervals between non-adjacent notes. An interval of of two whole steps is called a "major third." The interval of one and a half whole steps (three frets) is called a "minor third." What are the intervals between these pairs of notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A up to C?</li>
  <li>G down to E?</li>
  <li>F up to A?</li>
  <li>E down to C?</li>
  <li>F down to D?</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to answer all of these questions in your head, <em>without</em> looking at the diagram.</p>

<h3 id="the-note-a-at-fret-5">The note A at fret 5</h3>

<p>Back to learning the notes on string 6. Let’s first tackle the note “A” on the fifth fret.</p>

<div class="text-center">

</div>

<p>Like the open string and the 12th fret (where things repeat) the fifth fret is a good “landmark” for learning the remaining notes for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The fifth fret is almost halfway between the nut and the 12th fret. No matter where your hand is, you’re going to be close to the nut, the 5th fret, or the 12th fret. If you <strong>KNOW</strong> the notes at these locations, figuring out the rest is easier until you <strong>KNOW</strong> them as well.</p></li>

<li><p>The open 6th string is E and the note at the fifth fret is A. The open <em>5th</em> string is also an A. The interval from E up to A is known as an interval of a &ldquo;perfect fourth&rdquo; (because it’s four scale notes between E and A inclusive: EFGA — four notes). A guitar in standard tuning has the strings tuned in fourths (with one exception that we’ll get to later). E to A is a fourth. A to D is a fourth. D to G is a fourth. B to E is a fourth. Being able to find fourths <em>along</em> a string as well as <em>between</em> string pairs is extremely useful as we’ll see.</p></li>

<li><p>Because the guitar is (mostly) tuned in fourths, the notes at the fifth fret can be used to tune the next higher string. One way to tune the open 5th string (the note A) by ear is to play the 6th string at the 5th fret, then twist the tuning knob on the 5th string until it produces the same note. [I&rsquo;ll cover more tuning tricks and patterns in a separate blog post.]</p></li>
</ol>

<p><p></p>
<details><summary>Exercise 5: Twe E&#39;s and A on string 6 (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">

<p>Fret the 6th string at the fifth fret, sound the note, and say “A” out loud. Do this for open E, 12th fret E, and 5th fret A over and over until it’s deeply ingrained in your muscle memory. Drill in random order: high E, A, low E, A, low E, high E, ….</p>

<p>Drill in both directions: say a note name and find the fret, as well as fretting the note first, then saying the name. Do it until you can’t stand it any more. Do it with <em>intent</em> and “mindfulness” as the hippies say.</p>

<p>Note that the pattern repeats above the 12th fret: there is another A five frets above the 12th fret E at fret 17 (if you can reach it on your guitar).</p>

<p>Pluck the note at the fifth fret of string 6, then the open 5th string. Hopefully your ears will tell you that these are exactly the same note, and your brain will tell you that they are both A's.</p>

<p>Make up patterns through the 14 notes you've already learned (open strings, 12th fret, A's at fret 5 and 17). Say, up the open strings, down the 12th fret, high A then low A. Plus the reverse direction. Practice sequences of three or every other note through the patterns <em>with a metronome</em>.
</p>

</div>

</details>
</p>

<p>You now <strong>KNOW</strong> three of seven natural notes on the first string! It should take no effort whatsoever to find these notes on the sixth string given the note name, nor to play any of these notes and name them.</p>

<h3 id="adding-f-and-g">Adding F and G</h3>

<p>What note comes after E? (F, of course, just a half step up from E).</p>

<p>What note comes before A? (That would be G, down a <em>whole</em> step or two frets.)</p>

<p>If answering either of those questions took even a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, you should go back and repeat some of the earlier drills. Things get harder as we go forward. The more you solidify the easy stuff in your head, the easier things will go later. Baby steps. Do <strong>not</strong> feel obligated to complete this entire lesson in a day &mdash; take as long as it needs.</p>

<details><summary>Exercise 6: E, F, G, and A on string 6 (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">

<p>Slowly play and say these five notes: E on the open string, F at the first fret, G at the third fret, and A at the fifth fret. Repeat multiple times, going through the notes in order (EFGAE, then back to the open string E, then FGAE). Say the note names <strong>out loud</strong>. Repeat several times. You are programming your brain and muscles to associate these notes and these sounds with these locations.</p>

<p>Play as many of the E, F, G, and A notes as you can reach easily. Just knowing that the pattern repeats isn't the same as practicing with your hands and hearing the sounds with your ear!</p>

<p>Next, repeat the exercise, but go <em>backwards</em> from the highest note you can reach (say E at fret 12, then AGFE, then back to fret 12, EAGFE, …). Now do it in random order. Continue drilling until you feel like you can do it in your sleep. Use the diagram if you need to, but you’ll quickly realize you don’t need it. </strong>Say the note names out loud.</strong></p>

<p>Make up patterns through all 18 notes you've already learned (open strings, 12th fret, low FGA, high FGA). Again, one pattern might be up the open strings, down the 12th fret, high A then low A. Practice the reverse directions too. Practice sequences of three or every other note through the patterns <em>with a metronome</em>.
</p>
</div>

</details>
</p>

<p>You should now <strong>KNOW</strong> four of the seven natural notes on the sixth string (though it may take several days or even weeks for it to completely stick). If someone says &ldquo;G&rdquo; you should immediately, with <strong>no</strong> hesitation, visualize your left hand hovering over the third fret. Same thing for the other three notes (or any of the open string notes).</p>

<p>Do <strong>not</strong> move onto other exercises until you are 100% comfortable that you <strong>KNOW</strong> these 18 note locations.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a race. Nor is it like learning things in elementary school where you could stop drilling once you could reliably come up with the right answer (eventually). It&rsquo;s closer to exercising, or practicing your golf swing: no matter how well you know it, you can always get better and you never stop practicing. You want it to become absolutely automatic muscle memory where no conscious thought is required. It takes way more practice than you might realize!</p>

<h3 id="pilotage-vs-dead-reckoning">Pilotage vs. dead reckoning</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve spent an awful lot of time already just drilling with a few note locations. The reason is that these will become your <em>guideposts</em> or <em>landmarks</em> for finding other notes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like learning your way around a new city. At first you may only know a few landmarks (say your favorite coffee shop, your apartment, and where you work). If someone asks to meet you at any of these locations, you don&rsquo;t need any further directions: you know exactly where to go. This is <em>pilotage</em>.</p>

<p><em>Dead reckoning</em> is when you use tools like a a compass and some way to measure distances to navigate from a known location. It&rsquo;s the difference between &ldquo;meet me at Starbucks&rdquo; and &ldquo;take the third left down the street from Starbucks, and meet me at the brown bulding on the right at the end of the block.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eventually, we want to know all the natural notes everywhere on the neck by <strong>pilotage</strong>. We want to just know where they are without much thought. This will take quite a while, though. We&rsquo;ll use dead reckoning in the interim and just find notes relative to ones we already <strong>KNOW</strong>. But you simply must <strong>KNOW</strong> at least a few landmarks to get started.</p>

<p>This is why it&rsquo;s so important to drill excessively on these first four notes. The more notes you just <strong>KNOW</strong>, the easier the directions and faster the navigation to every place else.</p>

<h3 id="the-remaining-three-notes-b-c-and-d">The remaining three notes: B, C, and D.</h3>

<p>Now that you can pilot to four notes on the 6th string that you truly <strong>KNOW</strong>, let’s use relative thinking (dead reckoning) to find the remaining three.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the diagram for string 6 again:</p>

<div class="text-center">
  

<div class="box" >
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

      <figcaption><h4>Natural notes on the 6th string</h4>

</div>

</div>

<p>Because you already practiced learning the intervals in the major scale, B and D are trivial: B is up a whole step (two frets) from A, and D is <em>down</em> a whole step down from E.</p>

<p>(Now you see why we spent time with that silly exercise of saying the notes in the C Major scale backward.)</p>

<p>Once you truly <strong>KNOW</strong> B and D (and can pilot to them) it&rsquo;s easy to find C by dead reckoning: another half step (one fret) up from B, or a whole step down from D. Until then, you may have to follow two step directions to find it (e.g. &ldquo;Find B a whole step up from A, then go up another half step&rdquo;). Pretty soon, though, you should be able to start thinking in single steps (&ldquo;C is a minor third, or three frets up from A&rdquo;). Eventually, you&rsquo;ll truly <strong>KNOW</strong> at least one and hopefully all of these three notes.</p>

<p><p></p>
<details><summary>Exercise 7: All the natural notes on string 6 (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">

<p>Practice going through all seven notes in order (EFGABCDE) through the highest fret you can reach, forward and backward (EDBAGFE).</p>

<p>Next practice finding and saying the notes in random order (e.g.: BeDC AeBA GFAE FAeF GeCG EDGE EAG DeAE). Actually play and say the notes **out loud**. Find some sheet music or chord charts online to find sequences of notes to practice (just ignore sharps and flats).</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/fakebook_the-real-book-volume-3">The Real Book</a> is a good source of song charts, as is <a href="https://archive.org">archive.org</a> in general. If you know how to read notes you can use the melody lines, but even if not, the chord sequences help will give you sequences you can use. Just play the root of the chord, the first letter in the chord name, and ignore any sharps or flats. For "slash chords" showing notes in the bass of a chord, you can choose to play them or ignore them. The Mike Stern song on page 7, for example, shows the chords G/A F#/A Bm7 Em D A/C# in the first few measures, so you might play G A F A B E D A C.</p>

<p>As always, also practice going from location to note name, and not just name to location. That is, randomly fret one of the locations that you know and then say the note name out loud.</p>

<p>Next, try to pick out some simple melodies by ear using those notes (ideally ones in the key of C Major or A minor so there aren't any sharp or flat notes). Christmas carols are good for this. See if you can work out the beginning of Jingle Bells by ear starting with E at the 12th fret. If you've got an electric guitar, see if you can play the start of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" starting with the C at the 8th fret (you'll likely run out of frets on an acoustic).</p>

<p>Finally, find a backing track on YouTube that's in the key of C Major or A Minor, and randomly play these notes over it (still saying the note names out loud). The goal is to train your ear so that when you accidentally play a wrong note (a sharp or a flat note) you can hear it immediately.</p>

<p><a name="scalepractice"></a>
As you have learned, the top and bottom strings on the guitar are tuned to the same note, but two octaves apart.</p>

<p>This means that everything you&rsquo;ve learned on string 6 is immediately applicable to the high E string as well. By the time you get here, you will be well on your way to <strong>KNOWING</strong> over one third of the natural notes on the fretboard!</p>

<details><summary>Exercise 8: Pattern sequences to practice (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">
  <p>Practice finding all the A's you already <strong>KNOW</strong> (you know four of them if you can reach the 17th fret). Then find all the B's, then the C's, and so on, all the way up to G.</p>

  <p>You'll probably find it pretty easy to find each note sequentially, because each subsequent note is close to one you just found. So mix it up a bit. Make it harder. Find sources for other sequences of notes (or just make random strings of them).</p>

  <p>The following two sequences are particularly useful:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Mostly-Fourths: B E A D G C F B E A D G C F B E A .... Try not to always start on a different note, not always with B, but always follow the same order. [I call this sequence "mostly fourths" because it skips over any sharp/flat notes: a fourth up from F is Bb, not B (F to B is a M3). We are focusing on learning the natural notes in these exercises, and leaving sharps and flats to dead reckoning from an adjacent natural note.]</p></li>
      <li><p>Thirds: C E G, B D F, A C E, G B D, F A C, E G B, D F A. Repeat.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>The mostly-fourths sequence of natural notes is BEADGCF. Practice saying it out loud in order, over and over. Memorize the sequence using whatever mnemonic tricks work, but try to use that sequence for practicing as often as possible — it's far better than alphabetic order, forward or backward. I remember the sequence as the word "bead" followed by the initialism for "greatest common factor" (GCF). Meaningless, but it works for me. It also contains the order of the open strings (except, of course, for the B string).</p>

  <p>You should know that full "cycle of fourths" goes through all 12 notes, not just the seven natural notes. The full cycle of fourths is B E A D G C F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb, then it starts over again with B.</p>

  <p>The thirds sequence is FACEGBDF. Memorize this, too. Practice saying it in order. Then practice saying it in strings of three: C E G, B D F, A C E, G B D, F A C, E G B, D F A, then starting over with C E G. Each group of three notes is called a <em>triad</em>. You'll be spending a lot of time with them in the future, but for now just use them as a source for patterns.</p>

  <p>If you've ever learned how to read music on a treble clef in sheet music, these sequences should look familar. FACE (the word "face") are the notes on the open spaces between the lines of the clef. EGBDF ("every good boy does fine") are the notes on each line. It will prove incredibly valuable later to know the three notes in each three-note triad, so try to practice this way as often as possible.</p>

  <p>Using these sequences during your practice sessions is a great way to kill two birds with one stone. You're memorizing two important sequences, as well as mixing up the order of whatever you're practicing.</p>

  <p>Whenever you think you've got these sequences nailed, be sure to test yourself with a metronome to keep yourself honest. If you can't find/name the notes <em>in time</em> then you don't know them well enough</p>

<h3 id="practicing-with-actual-songs">Practicing with actual songs</h3>

<p>You can make a surprising amount of actual music with just the notes in that last diagram. In addition to simple melodies on the high E string, you can also play <strong>chords</strong> that have the root on the 5th string.</p>

<p>The simplest of all chords are so-called &ldquo;power chords&rdquo; or 5-chords. Here&rsquo;s an A5 power chord, for example, that has the root on the 6th string (the hollow dot is optional, you can also mute that string if you want):</p>

<div class="text-center">

<p>You already <strong>KNOW</strong> that the fifth fret of the low E string is the note A. Play that shape at the fifth fret as shown in the diagram, and you are playing an A5 power chord. Move it up two frets and you are playing a B5 (because we know that fret 7 is the note B). Guess where you move to play C5?</p>

<details><summary>Exercise 9: Smoke on the Water (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">

<p>The first song kids of my generation learned was often Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple. The song was written in G minor, but we can transpose the main riff to the key of A so that there are fewer flatted notes.
The main riff in Am is as follows:</p>

<div class="text-center">


<div class="box" >
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <div class="img" style="background-image: url('https://lessons.doiwalters.com/img/smoke-slash.png');">

      <figcaption><h4>Smoke on the Water (riff in Am)</h4>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<p></div></p>

<p>If, by some miracle, you've never heard the riff, and you don't yet know how to read rhythm notation, it sounds like [this in Gm](/audio/smoke-on-the-water-Gm.mp3) Using power chords rooted on the sixth string isn't the easiest way to play the riff, but it's not all that hard (it helps to play extremely slowly at first).</p>

<p>That one brief Eb, of course, is just one fret below E, so you find it at the 11th fret, the rest you already <strong>KNOW</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to play along with an actual band, YouTube, or the audio file I linked to above, you must move everything down two frets to transpose everything to Gm.</p>

<p>Either way, the exercise is to play this riff while naming the root notes you&rsquo;re playing: &ldquo;A, C, Dee &hellip; A, C, Eb-dee &hellip;.&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Crank it up and have fun, but remember the purpose of the exercise is to cement the location of the notes into your brain and fingers. It&rsquo;s not for ear training or technique. The idea is to <strong>find those notes</strong> on the fretboard using the chord names above (A5, C5, D5, &hellip;).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve not included the tablature in this section. If you really can&rsquo;t figure it out for some reason, <a href="/img/smoke-tab.png">here is the tab in Gm</a>. The tab is in Gm, but if you shift it up to Am there will be fewer flatted notes to contend with (you&rsquo;ll be playing the notes you&rsquo;ve already learned except for that brief Eb).</p>

<p></div></p>

</details>


<p>Power chords have some nice characteristics:</p>

<p>Power chords are neither major nor minor, so you can play them over (almost) <strong>any</strong> chord that shares the same root.</p>

<p>If a song uses the chord progression  G / C  / D, you can play G5 / C5 / D5. If it&rsquo;s C / Am / Dm / G7 / C, you can play C5 / A5 / D5 / G5 / C5. If the chart says Em7#9 you can probably get away with just playing E5 (and let someone else in the band take care of all those other notes).</p>

<p>[The only exception is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord">altered chords</a> where the fifth is flattened or sharpened, by the way. So if you see a chord with a name like Dm7b5, or anything with &ldquo;-/+/b/#&rdquo; next to the number 5, a power chord may not sound that great over it.]</p>

<p>Because any note you play on a guitar includes the fifth of that note as an overtone already, playing a note+fifth (a power chord) is basically just playing a &ldquo;fatter&rdquo; version of the original note. This means it sounds <strong>great</strong> with as much distortion as you want to throw at it. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about the nasty discordant sound you can get when you distort more complicated chords.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s drill with some actual songs. Using real songs to practice has a couple advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Different songs use some extremely common patterns (you may have heard terms like &ldquo;a I IV V progression&rdquo; or a &ldquo;I vi ii V&rdquo; progression). Giving your hands and ears practice at finding these common sequences will pay off later.</p></li>

<li><p>Playing along with music forces you to keep time. There is nothing like a steady beat to keep you honest about how well you <strong>KNOW</strong> the fretboard locations!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>At this point we should try to limit ourselves to songs that use as few sharps and flats as possible. Good sources of material are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=christmas+carol+chords">Christmas Carols</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=country+music+chords+for+guitar">Country/Traditional music</a>. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://archive.org/details/HankWilliamsSongsWithChords">a nice free Hank Williams songbook</a> on <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>, which is a terrific resource for finding things in the public domain.</p>

<details><summary>Exercise 10: Practice with chord progressions (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">
  <p>Find the chords and a recording for any song you like, ideally one with a slow tempo, simple rhythm, and without too many chords or changes or flats and sharps in the chords. For example, search YouTube for "Cold, Cold Heart" by Hank Williams. You can find the chords on page 5 of <a href="https://archive.org/details/HankWilliamsSongsWithChords">this songbook</a>.</p>

  <p>Look through the song and write down the chords in the order they occur. For Cold, Cold Heart, the sequence is D A D G A D in that order, repeated for each verse. Make sure you can find those power chords easily and remember the order.</p>

  <p>Play the song all the way through at least once before you pick up your guitar. Tap your foot along with the song to find the downbeats. Try to say out loud the name of chord on each downbeat as it plays. For Cold, Cold Heart, it would be something like this:</p>

<pre>
Hank sings: I try so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream ....
You say:   /  D      D       D       D /  D    D         D     A /

  <p>You should be saying "D" right when Hank sings "try," and "A" at the exact instant that Hank sings "dream". Practice this with every line until you're sure you know the order of the chords (root notes). Just say the notes at this point without playing them.</p>

  <p>Now repeat the exercise, but this time actually play the power-chord as you say the name. Try to play in time, changing chords right on the downbeat of each chord change. You'll likely find it important to think ahead and plan for the next change.</p>

  <p>Understand that this is intended to be <strong>practice</strong>, not <strong>playing</strong>. Don't worry about making it sound great (heavy-metal-ish power chords over classic country probably won't!). Also try not to lose focus or start goofing around with other songs/melodies you're reminded of. We are drilling to be able to find notes quickly and in time. We want to test that we truly **KNOW** the locations, not to have fun making music (at least not yet). Practice should be disciplined and structured.</p>

  <p>If you're playing a song with very few chord changes per measure, practice playing the same chord multiple times within each measure, right on the downbeat. See if you can make each change in time to keep up the rhythm. For example, with Cold, Cold Heart, the chords are:</p>
