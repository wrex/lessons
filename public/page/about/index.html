<p>This site&rsquo;s conceit is to take an engineer&rsquo;s approach to teaching the instrument. It attempts to be an &ldquo;Operator&rsquo;s Manual&rdquo; for the guitar, written by an engineer for other engineers.</p>

<p>Engineers can&rsquo;t help themselves from asking &ldquo;why&rdquo; at every conceivable step of a learning process. Music is such a deep topic that it&rsquo;s easy to get lost in the weeds doing this, but the only thing worse to an engineer than not getting an answer is getting a wrong one! If an engineer senses that a teacher is glossing over something, they&rsquo;ll usually tune them out and try to research on their own no matter how accomplished the teacher.</p>

<p>Engineers like myself tend to jump to new areas of study <em>long</em> before we are ready. Because we generally understand complex topics quickly, we tend to move onto the next topic way, <em>way</em>, <strong>way</strong> too early. We think we understand something, when we&rsquo;ve really just barely scratched the surface.</p>

<p>Most of the guitar and music theory material on the internet is (shockingly) written by actual musicians or music educators (sometimes extremely accomplished ones). I&rsquo;m definitely <strong>not</strong> an accomplished musician! But, as an engineer, I know how we think, how we like to learn, and I certainly know what works for me.</p>

<p>Many musicians don&rsquo;t know much about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_resonance">string resonance and overtones</a>, for example, nor do they likely care. Many may even claim they don&rsquo;t know much or care much about music theory at all. [This is usually completely untrue, by the way: they often know a <em>lot</em> about music theory, but they only know how to express and recognize it using their instrument and ears, not in words, diagrams, or concepts.]</p>

<p>Engineers <em>want</em> the theory. They <em>like</em> words, diagrams, and concepts! If you want to lose an engineer, just tell them to &ldquo;keep playing this pattern of notes over and over this groove &mdash; eventually you&rsquo;ll start to hear which notes sound best&rdquo;. Watch their heads explode!</p>

<p>The hardest lesson about music for me personally seems obvious to normal people (non-engineers) but was contrary to all of my previous experiences with learning: Merely <em>understanding</em> something, just being able to answer a question or reason about something was almost useless! The sheer depth of understanding required, and the <em>degree</em> of drilling and repetition required <em>after</em> reaching the point of understanding utterly shocked me. <strong>Practice wasn&rsquo;t just for improving manual dexterity, it was also for deep learning and internalizing.</strong> This was utterly new to me.</p>

<p>I distinctly remember thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just learn theory first, then I can take my time practicing technique once I understand everything.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t too keen on practicing any given thing before I understood all the <em>whys</em> (I suppose I was worried that I&rsquo;d waste time practicing unneccessary things). I naively under-appreciated the <em>degree</em> to which I needed to understand each underlying concept.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t understand that practice wasn&rsquo;t just for technique!</p>

<p>As an example, I clearly remember one of my first instructors (a jazz guitarist) teaching me triads. After one afternoon figuring out the three inversions on each string set, I thought I was finished with the subject! &ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo; (It makes me laugh to even think about this now. I honestly think I may spend the rest of my life studying some of the nuances of triads, )</p>

<p>Eventually, the penny dropped: rough understanding is just the <em>start</em> of the process, not the end.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to know how triads are formed. You want to internalize the idea to a <em>profound</em> degree. You want to instantly, effortlessly, almost without thought just <strong>KNOW</strong> that a C Major is the notes C, E, and G. That they are a minor third stacked on top of a major third. That three different close-voicings for C exist, here, here, and here on <em>each</em> ajacent set of three strings. You want to be able to know <em>instantly</em> where the C, the E, the G is within each of those 20 or so positions on the neck. That they interconnect like <em>this</em>. Then you want to repeat all this for the other three triad types (minor, diminished, and augmented).</p>

<p>You want to know all those triads as well as you recognize your families faces. You want to be able execute all of this <em>in time</em> without pause. Only then will you really know your triads.</p>

<p>Of course, only a lifetime of never-ending practice will let you achieve this degree of &ldquo;knowing,&rdquo; but more than anything else, this is the lesson I hope to impart to other engineers: mere understanding is nowhere near sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="my-background">My background</h3>

<p>My father gave me my first guitar in about 1973. I&rsquo;ve been struggling to learn the instrument off and on since then. Even I&rsquo;ll admit that I&rsquo;m still pretty hopeless, but I&rsquo;ve made more progress over the past year or two than the prior three <em>decades</em>.</p>

<p>I owe it to countless online videos, websites, ebooks, apps, in-person, and remote instructors (<em>especially</em> Josh at <a href="http://fretboardanatomy.com">Fretboard Anatomy</a>, Yaakov at <a href="http://gypsyandjazz.com">Gypsy and Jazz</a>, and Jeff McErlain at <a href="http://truefire.com">Truefire</a>). I&rsquo;ve distilled and synthesized a few things of my own from all those sources, and I simply wanted to share.</p>

<p>[As an aside, I <strong>distinctly</strong> remember discovering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-line_Guitar_Archive">OLGA</a> sometime in the early nineties, as well as my feelings when I looked over at the unsorted mess of tabs, chord charts and cut-out pages from magazines piled in my old pasteboard guitar case. Today we have YouTube and all the rest (and gig bags that actually hold together for a few years). It&rsquo;s so, <strong>so</strong> much easier to learn the instrument today than it was when I started! Honestly, the challenge today has become not continually being distracted by the terrific source of training material!]</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had many recent epiphanies. They were such a revelation that I want everyone to have the same experience. Despite my woeful skills, I still believe that some of the things that caused things to &ldquo;click&rdquo; for me recently might also help others. As they say: Those that can, do. Those that can&rsquo;t, teach.</p>

<p>The site isn&rsquo;t completely altruistic, either. I&rsquo;m certainly still learning, and I fully subscribe to the theory that there is no better way to <strong>really</strong> learn something than by attempting to teach it to someone else.</p>

<p>Beginners like myself sometimes make good teachers because they benefit from what I once heard described as &ldquo;new eyes.&rdquo; (Full disclosure: my eyes aren&rsquo;t exactly new &mdash; I walk into walls without my glasses.)</p>

<p>Experienced professionals often make terrible teachers precisely because they already understand <em>everything</em> about what they are attempting to teach. They sometimes forget what it&rsquo;s like for a beginner that doesn&rsquo;t have all the relevant background.</p>

<p>Guitar and music theory is such a deep subject that it&rsquo;s likely impossible to organize lessons without skipping over some things, but I&rsquo;ve tried hard to include the most critical concepts in each post, without making it hopelessly slow and dull. I&rsquo;ve also tried to include the little nuggets that helped make it click for me.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you find anything on this site useful. Otherwise, contact my assistant and I&rsquo;ll be happy to provide a full refund.</p>
