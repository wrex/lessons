<p>This document presents a number of exercises to learn the names of all the natural notes on the fretboard.</p>

<p>Try not to be intimidated, but here is what we are eventually going to learn (this diagram is just for the first 15 frets, but you will learn your entire fretboard). You&rsquo;ll eventually be able to find and name every single note in this diagram <em>effortlessly</em>:</p>

<p>[If you&rsquo;ve already learned the note locations, by the way, just take a moment to gaze at the ordered complexity of that diagram. Bask in the glory of how much you&rsquo;ve already accomplished. The human brain is amazing. That&rsquo;s quite an accomplishment to learn all that! Learning guitar is <strong>hard</strong> &mdash; it&rsquo;s all too easy to despair. It&rsquo;s important to take a moment periodically and rejoice at how much progress you&rsquo;ve already made. A positive attitude really is important.]</p>

<p>Before you begin, be sure to <strong>tune your guitar</strong> every single time you attempt any of these exercises. These days there is no real excuse for not having some sort of electronic tuner (either a standalone piece of hardware or an app on your phone) but however you do it, be sure your strings are in standard tuning before you do anything else, even if you have to ask a friend to do it for you at first.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to begin training your brain to hear notes in tune. Every time you practice without tuning up, you risk programming your brain with bad information.</p>

<p>Come back to this page and repeat any or all of these exercises as many times as you feel is necessary. Repeat until you are confident you truly <strong>KNOW</strong> the notes.</p>

<p>Feel free to read through all of this before attempting the exercises, but merely reading an exercise is very different from performing it. All of the exercises should be repeated multiple times.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve given little indication of how long each exercise should take or how many times you should repeat it before moving on. Only you will know when you&rsquo;ve truly mastered an exercise. It&rsquo;s pretty normal to get through strings 6 and string 1 in the first day, but you may still find yourself coming back to those exercises occasionally.</p>

<p>The goal is <strong>not</strong> to get through all of this as quickly as possible, it&rsquo;s to truly <strong>KNOW</strong> the fretboard.</p>

<h2 id="open-strings">Open strings</h2>

<p>We number the strings starting from 1, the thinnest string closest to the floor, to 6, the thickest closest to your chin.</p>

<p>Terminology can get confusing, so this site always uses terms like &ldquo;up,&rdquo; &ldquo;down,&rdquo; &ldquo;higher,&rdquo; &ldquo;lower,&rdquo; <em>etc.</em> relative to <strong>pitch</strong> and not relative to physical topology.</p>

<p>That is, the 6th string is <strong>lower</strong> than the 1st string, even though it&rsquo;s physically farther from the floor. Similarly, a note played at the 5th fret is &ldquo;lower down the neck&rdquo; than one played at the 12th fret of the same string, even though proper form has one holding the headstock physically higher than the bridge of the instrument. To play on a lower string means to move your hand further from the floor. To play higher up the neck moves your left hand closer to your right.</p>

<p>From low to high (6th to 1st strings) the strings are tuned to the notes E, A, D, G, B, and E. You simply have to memorize this, there is no shortcut. The E produced by the open 1st string is two octaves higher than the one produced on the open 6th string.</p>

<details><summary>Exercise 1: Open Strings (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">
<h4>Exercise 1: Open strings</h4>

<p>Pluck each string in order, 6, then 5, ..., up to the 1st string, saying the corresponding note name for each string <strong>out loud</strong>. Repeat this multiple times until you are completely confident you've got it memorized. It's important to say the note name out loud, it truly helps your brain to make the connection. This may seem foolishly easy, but things will get much harder quickly &mdash; every second spent ensuring the easy stuff is truly effortless is invaluable.</p>

<p>Now try it going in the other direction, plucking 1, then 2, 3, 4, 5, and finally 6 this time. You may discover you don't know the names as well as you thought. Going backwards can sometimes be surprisingly difficult.</p>

<p>Next, try every other string: 6 4 5 3 4 2 3 1. Then the other direction: 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6. Again, be sure to say the note name <strong>out loud</strong>.</p>

<p>Now try a couple different patterns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sequences of 3 up: 6 5 4, 5 4 3, 4 3 2, 3 2 1, and down: 1 2 3, 2 3 4, 3 4 5, 4 5 6.</li>
  <li>Every other string: 6 4, 5 3, 4 2, 3 1, then 1 3, 2 4, 3 5, 4 6.</li>
</ul>

<p>Out loud, every time.</p>

Next, instead of going from string to name, we are going to drill going from note name to string.

Practice plucking this random string of notes on the open strings (where lower case "e" indicates the note on the 1st string):

DDGA AEBD BEeE GDeB ABAE DBGA BABe AeDB
</div>

</details>
</p>

<p>It may seem like incredible overkill to go through all this for something you probably felt you had memorized after reading it once, but trust me that the rigor is worth it.</p>

<p>Keep drilling until you have absolutely no &ldquo;mental friction&rdquo; or delays. Most people <strong>KNOW</strong> the open notes within just a few minutes or so of exercise 1, but don&rsquo;t hesitate to take as long as necessary.</p>

<p><p></p>
<details><summary>Exercise 2: Notes at the 12th fret (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">
<p>Here's a free bonus! The notes at the 12th fret are exactly the same as the open strings:</p>

<div class="text-center">
  

<div class="box" style="max-width:33%">
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

</div>

<p></div></p>

<p><p>Repeat Exercise 1, but this time use the 12th fret instead of open strings.</p>
</div></p>

</details>
</p>

<p>Do it!</p>

<p>You may think some of these exercies are completely unnecessary, and you may even be right, but it&rsquo;s an extremely bad habit to think you can perform something on the guitar without actually doing it. You may be surprised. You&rsquo;re also programming your brain by associating sounds and fretting locations with note names. Lastly, it&rsquo;s important to spend at least a little time <strong>practicing things you can do easily</strong>. It&rsquo;s easy to become demotivated if you only practice things you <strong>can&rsquo;t</strong> do! (Within moderation, of course, the once you can perform an exercise effortlessly, it&rsquo;s time to move on.)</p>

<p><p></p>
<details><summary>Exercise 3: The C Major scale out loud (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">
<p>This is an exercise that doesn't even require a guitar.</p>

<p>As stupid as it sounds, the drill is to practice saying the note names in order, <strong>out loud</strong>. Get used to going from G to A (there is no note H, so you’ve got to get your brain used to “rolling around” every time you get to G). "A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A ...."</p>

<p>Next spend a minute or two doing this starting on random notes: BCDEFGAB, then EFGABCDE, then GABCDEFG, etc. Do it! You need to <strong>KNOW</strong> that the note after G is A (every bit as well as you know that the note after A is B!)</p>

<p>Now we are going to make it a little harder. It’s not enough to know the notes forward, you must also <strong>KNOW</strong> them backwards! Practice, <strong>out loud</strong>, reciting the notes in reverse order (rolling back from A down to G in this case). </p>

<p>You’ll find this a little strange at first, we aren’t used to reciting the alphabet backwards but musicians need to know scales and notes forward, backward, and in arbitrary order! Again, practice starting on any random note and recite the notes backwards: CBAGFEDC, GFEDCBAG, AGFEDCBA, etc. Do this until it feels natural and automatic, with no thought required.</p>
</div>

</details>
</p>

<p>Do it! No matter how stupid you feel.</p>

<h2 id="the-sixth-string">The sixth string</h2>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve got the open strings (and 12th fret) down, let’s learn the seven natural notes on string six. Here’s the complete diagram:</p>

<div class="text-center">
  

<div class="box" >
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <div class="img">
      <img itemprop="thumbnail" src="/img/neck-diagrams/e6-string.png" alt="/img/neck-diagrams/e6-string.png"/>
    </div>
    <a href="/img/neck-diagrams/e6-string.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption><h4>Natural notes on the 6th string</h4>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

</div>

<p>These notes also happen to map to the white keys on a piano. The red C is notated on the staff as &ldquo;middle C&rdquo; on sheet music for guitar, but produces a pitch exactly one octave lower than middle C on a piano.</p>

<p>We’re going to work our way up to memorizing all of these notes incrementally in this section. (Even if this looks somewhat intimidating, it shouldn&rsquo;t take you more than one practice session to <strong>KNOW</strong> (or at least almost <strong>KNOW</strong>) these notes.</p>

<p>Before we tackle learning the notes between the two we already know (the E’s on the open string and fret 12) examine the spacing between each of the labeled notes (the natural notes).</p>

<p>Almost all the notes have two frets (also called a &ldquo;whole step&rdquo;) between them. The only exceptions are between note E and F, and between B and C (with only one fret, or a half step between these pairs of notes). This is important: half steps between B/C and E/F, whole steps everywhere else. Remember this!</p>

<p>The seven natural notes A-G are also known as the C Major scale or &ldquo;C Ionian&rdquo; (which is why the C notes in the diagram are red — C is the root note of the corresponding scale).</p>

<p>If we start from the root C, the pattern of whole steps and half steps is W W h W W W h before we get back to the root again. That is, C to D is a whole step (W), D to E another whole step (W), E to F is only a half step (h), then back to a whole step from F to G, etc.</p>

<p>The diagram stops at fret 15, but the pattern continues indefinitely. Imagine that the diagram is infinitely long, or that fret fifteen wraps back onto fret 3.</p>

<p>Memorize this pattern: Whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half. Again, we are starting from C and only dealing with natural notes (no sharps or flats): C (W) D (W) E (h) F (W) G (W) A (W) B (h) C ....</p>

<p>Recite the "whole whole half whole whole whole half" sequence until you can repeat it in your sleep. <strong>All</strong> of western music derives from this one pattern!</p>

<p>What's the interval between A and B? Between E and F? Between G and A? Between B and C? Between D and E?</p>

<p>Now consider progressing backwards, <em>down</em> the scale. What is the interval from D down to C? From F down to E? From A down to G?</p>

<p>Practice saying any random note from the seven and answering how large the interval is up and down to the adjacent notes.</p>

<p>Extra credit: The interval of two whole steps is called a "major third." The interval of 1.5 whole steps (three frets) is called a "minor third." What are the intervals between these pairs of notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A up to C?</li>
  <li>G down to E?</li>
  <li>F up to A?</li>
  <li>E down to C?</li>
  <li>F down to D?</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to answer all of these questions in your head, <em>without</em> looking at the diagram.</p>

<h3 id="the-note-a-at-fret-5">The note A at fret 5</h3>

<p>Back to learning the notes on string 6. Let’s first tackle the note “A” on the fifth fret.</p>

</div>

<p>Like the open string and the 12th fret (where things repeat) the fifth fret is a good “landmark” for learning the remaining notes for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The fifth fret is almost halfway between the nut and the 12th fret. No matter where your hand is, you’re going to be close to the nut, the 5th fret, or the 12th fret. If you <strong>KNOW</strong> the notes at these locations, figuring out the rest is easier until you <strong>KNOW</strong> them as well.</p></li>

<li><p>The open 6th string is E and the note at the fifth fret is A. The open <em>5th</em> string is also an A. The interval from E up to A is known as an interval of a &ldquo;perfect fourth&rdquo; (because it’s four scale notes between E and A inclusive: EFGA — four notes). A guitar in standard tuning has the strings tuned in fourths (with one exception that we’ll get to later). E to A is a fourth. A to D is a fourth. D to G is a fourth. B to E is a fourth. Being able to find fourths <em>along</em> a string as well as <em>between</em> string pairs is extremely useful as we’ll see.</p></li>

<li><p>Because the guitar is (mostly) tuned in fourths, the notes at the fifth fret can be used to tune the next higher string. One way to tune the open 5th string (the note A) by ear is to play the 6th string at the 5th fret, then twist the tuning knob on the 5th string until it produces the same note. [I&rsquo;ll cover more tuning tricks and patterns in a separate blog post.]</p></li>
</ol>

<p><p></p>
<details><summary>Exercise 5: Twe E&#39;s and A on string 6 (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">

<p>Fret the 6th string at the fifth fret, sound the note, and say “A” out loud. Do this for open E, 12th fret E, and 5th fret A over and over until it’s deeply ingrained in your muscle memory. Drill in random order: high E, A, low E, A, low E, high E, ….</p>

<p>Drill in both directions: say a note name and find the fret, as well as fretting the note first, then saying the name. Do it until you can’t stand it any more. Do it with <em>intent</em> and “mindfulness” as the hippies say.</p>

<p>Note that the pattern repeats above the 12th fret: there is another A five frets above the 12th fret E at fret 17 (if you can reach it on your guitar).</p>


</div>

</details>
</p>

<p>You now <strong>KNOW</strong> three of seven natural notes on the first string! It should take no effort whatsoever to find these notes on the sixth string given the note name, nor to play any of these notes and name them.</p>

<h3 id="adding-f-and-g">Adding F and G</h3>

<p>What note comes after E? (F, of course, just a half step up from E).</p>

<p>What note comes before A? (That would be G, down a <em>whole</em> step or two frets.)</p>

<p>If answering either of those questions took even a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, you should go back and repeat some of the earlier drills. Things get harder as we go forward. The more you solidify the easy stuff in your head, the easier things will go later. Baby steps. Do <strong>not</strong> feel obligated to complete this entire lesson in a day &mdash; take as long as it needs.</p>

<details><summary>Exercise 6: E, F, G, and A on string 6 (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">

<p>Slowly play and say these five notes: E on the open string, F at the first fret, G at the third fret, and A at the fifth fret. Repeat multiple times, going through the notes in order (EFGAE, then back to the open string E, then FGAE). Say the note names <strong>out loud</strong>. Repeat several times. You are programming your brain and muscles to associate these notes and these sounds with these locations.</p>

<p>If you can reach beyond the 12th fret on your guitar, play as many of the E, F, G, and A notes as you can reach easily. Just knowing that the pattern repeats isn't the same as practicing with your hands and hearing the sounds with your ear!</p>

<p>Next, repeat the exercise, but go <em>backwards</em> from the highest note you can reach (say E at fret 12, then AGFE, then back to fret 12, EAGFE, …). Now do it in random order. Continue drilling until you feel like you can do it in your sleep. Use the diagram if you need to, but you’ll quickly realize you don’t need it. </strong>Say the note names out loud.</strong></p>

<p>Try randomly saying one of the four note names (EFGA) out loud first, before playing the note, then playing it on your instrument. Going from note-name to location is a very different mental process than going from location to note-name. You need to practice both.</p>

<p>Repeat!</p>
</div>

</details>
</p>

<p>You should now <strong>KNOW</strong> four of the seven natural notes on the sixth string (though it may take several days or even weeks for it to completely stick). If someone says &ldquo;G&rdquo; you should immediately, with <strong>no</strong> hesitation, visualize your left hand hovering over the third fret. Same thing for the other three notes (or any of the open string notes).</p>

<p>Do <strong>not</strong> move onto other exercises until you are 100% comfortable that you <strong>KNOW</strong> these 17+ locations (including the the repeated notes at and above the 12th fret). Be sure you know the open strings just as well.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a race. Nor is it like learning things in elementary school where you could stop drilling once you could reliably come up with the right answer (eventually). It&rsquo;s closer to exercising, or practicing your golf swing: no matter how well you know it, you can always get better and you never stop practicing. You want it to become absolutely automatic muscle memory where no conscious thought is required. It takes way more practice than you might realize!</p>

<h3 id="pilotage-vs-dead-reckoning">Pilotage vs. dead reckoning</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve spent an awful lot of time already just drilling with four notes on the 6th string. The reason is that these will become your <em>guideposts</em> or <em>landmarks</em> for finding other notes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like learning your way around a new city. At first you may only know a few landmarks (say your favorite coffee shop, your apartment, and where you work). If someone asks to meet you at any of these locations, you don&rsquo;t need any further directions: you know exactly where to go. This is <em>pilotage</em>.</p>

<p><em>Dead reckoning</em> is when you use a compass and distances to navigate from a known location. It&rsquo;s the difference between &ldquo;meet me at Peets&rdquo; and &ldquo;take the third left down the street from Peets, and meet me at the brown bulding on the right at the end of the block.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eventually, we want to know all the natural notes everywhere on the neck by <strong>pilotage</strong>. We want to just know where they are without much thought. This will take quite a while, though. We&rsquo;ll use dead reckoning in the interim and just find notes relative to ones we already <strong>KNOW</strong>. But you simply must <strong>KNOW</strong> at least a few landmarks to get started.</p>

<p>This is why it&rsquo;s so important to drill excessively on these first four notes. The more notes you just <strong>KNOW</strong>, the easier the directions and faster the navigation to every place else.</p>

<h3 id="the-remaining-three-notes-b-c-and-d">The remaining three notes: B, C, and D.</h3>

<p>Now that you can pilot to four notes you truly <strong>KNOW</strong>, let’s use relative thinking (dead reckoning) to find the remaining three.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the diagram for string 6 again:</p>

<div class="text-center">
  

<div class="box" >
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <div class="img">
      <img itemprop="thumbnail" src="/img/neck-diagrams/e6-string.png" alt="/img/neck-diagrams/e6-string.png"/>
    </div>
    <a href="/img/neck-diagrams/e6-string.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
      <figcaption><h4>Natural notes on the 6th string</h4>
      </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

</div>

<p>Because you already practiced learning the intervals in the major scale, B and D are trivial: B is up a whole step (two frets) from A, and D is <em>down</em> a whole step down from E.</p>

<p>(Now you see why we spent time with that silly exercise of saying the notes in the C Major scale backward.)</p>

<p>Once you truly <strong>KNOW</strong> B and D (and can pilot to them) it&rsquo;s easy to find C by dead reckoning: another half step (one fret) up from B, or a whole step down from D. Until then, you may have to follow two step directions to find it (e.g. &ldquo;Find B a whole step up from A, then go up another half step&rdquo;). Pretty soon, though, you should be able to start thinking in single steps (&ldquo;C is a minor third, or three frets up from A&rdquo;). Eventually, though, you&rsquo;ll truly <strong>KNOW</strong> at least one of these three notes (Ideally C since it&rsquo;s the root of the C Major scale).</p>

<p><p></p>
<details><summary>Exercise 7: All the natural notes on string 6 (click to expand)</summary>
<div class="bg-info">

Practice going through all seven notes in order (EFGABCDE) through the highest fret you can reach, forward and backward (EDBAGFE).

Next practice finding and saying the notes in random order (e.g.: BeDC AeBA GFAE FAeF GeCG EDGE EAG DeAE). Actually play and say the notes **out loud**. Find some sheet music or chord charts online to find sequences of notes to practice (just ignore sharps and flats).

[The "real book"](https://archive.org/details/fakebook_the-real-book-volume-3) is a good source of note sequences, as is archive.org in general. If you know how to read notes you can use the melody lines, but even if not the chord sequences help. The Mike Stern song on page 7, for example shows the chords G/A F#/A Bm7 Em D A/C# in the first few measures. Just ignore anything that isn't a note you know and play G A F A B E D A C.

As always, also practice going from location to note name rather than only finding notes by name. That is, randomly fret one of the locations that you know and then say the note name out loud.

Next, try to pick out some simple melodies by ear using those notes. Christmas carols are good for this. See if you can work out the beginning of Jingle Bells by ear starting with E at the 12th fret. If you've got an electric guitar, see if you can play the start of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" starting with the C at the 8th fret (you'll likely run out of frets on an acoustic).

Finally, find a backing track on YouTube that's in the key of C Major or A Minor, and randomly play these notes over it (still saying the note names out loud). The goal is to train your ear so that when you accidentally play a wrong note (a sharp or a flat note) you can hear it immediately

<h3 id="free-bonus-2">Free bonus #2!</h3>

<p>As you have learned, the top and bottom strings on the guitar are tuned to the same note, but two octaves apart.</p>

<p>This means that everything you&rsquo;ve learned on string 6 is immediately applicable to the high E string! By the time you get here, you will already <strong>KNOW</strong> over one third of the natural notes on the fretboard!</p>

</div>

<p>Repeat any and all of these exercises, alternating between notes on the first and sixth strings.</p>

<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll learn the remaining natural notes at fret 5 and on string 5, then look at octave shapes so you can find any note by dead reckoning. Finally, we will move onto the remaining strings 2, 3, and 4. At that point, you will truly <strong>KNOW</strong> the entire fretboard!</p>
